# AI Monitor Improvements - July 2025

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the AI Monitor CLI tool to reduce false positive interventions and optimize API costs.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Stuck Detection

**Previous Behavior:**
- Vague criteria: "repeating same failed actions multiple times"
- Led to false positives during normal debugging

**New Behavior:**
- Clear criteria: AI is stuck when there are **20+ conversation turns without meaningful progress** toward the high-level goal
- Explicitly excludes normal activities:
  - Normal debugging (trying different approaches)
  - Waiting for tests, builds, or installations
  - Reading/analyzing code
  - Working through complex problems methodically
  - Making steady progress even if slow

### 2. Full Conversation Context

**Previous Behavior:**
- Only sent last 20 JSONL entries
- Truncated responses to 500 chars, tool results to 200 chars
- Limited ability to detect patterns over time

**New Behavior:**
- Sends up to 7,000 entries (stays within 1M token Gemini limit)
- No truncation - full conversation history preserved
- Turn tracking added to monitor conversation flow
- Shows total turn count for easy progress assessment

### 3. Cost Optimization with Gemini Caching

**Previous Costs:**
- ~$30/day for continuous monitoring (every 60 seconds)
- Each check sent full prompt at full price

**New Costs with Caching:**
- ~$8/day with Gemini's implicit context caching
- 73.7% cost reduction verified by tests
- First prompt: Full price on ~100-200K tokens
- Subsequent prompts: 75% discount on cached tokens
- Only new content charged at full rate

### 4. Improved Prompt Design

The new prompt clearly defines intervention criteria:
1. **Workflow Violations** - Immediate intervention
2. **Stuck Detection** - Only after 20+ turns without progress

The prompt also specifies when NOT to intervene, reducing false positives.

## Testing

### Test Suite Created

1. **Basic Functionality Test** (`test-framework.js`)
   - Verifies core components work correctly
   - Tests turn tracking and prompt generation

2. **Comprehensive Scenarios** (`test-scenarios.js`)
   - 10 compliant scenarios (should NOT intervene)
   - 10 violation scenarios (should intervene)
   - Covers common development patterns

3. **Cost Analysis Test** (`test-caching-costs.js`)
   - Verifies 73.7% cost reduction with caching
   - Calculates daily operational costs

### Running Tests

```bash
# Basic functionality test
node tests/test-framework.js

# Simple verification test
node tests/run-simple-test.js

# Cost reduction test
node tests/test-caching-costs.js

# Full test suite (requires Gemini API)
node tests/test-scenarios.js
```

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes in `screen-monitor.js`

1. **Line 412**: Changed from `.slice(-20)` to `.slice(-7000)` to send more context
2. **Lines 440-500**: Added turn tracking to conversation formatting
3. **Lines 490-495**: Removed truncation of responses and tool results
4. **Lines 725-758**: Completely rewrote compliance prompt with clear criteria

### API Usage Estimation

- Average JSONL entry: ~500 characters
- 7,000 entries ≈ 3.5M characters ≈ 875K tokens
- Safely within Gemini's 1M token context window

## Usage Guidelines

### When AI Monitor Should Intervene

1. **Workflow Violations**
   - Skipping planning phases
   - Not using todo lists
   - Skipping test gates
   - Committing without permission

2. **Genuine Stuck Situations** (20+ turns)
   - Repeating exact same failed action
   - No progress on todo items
   - Stuck on 2FA without asking for help

### When AI Monitor Should NOT Intervene

1. **Normal Development**
   - Debugging with different approaches
   - Waiting for long processes
   - Reading/analyzing code
   - Iterative UI development
   - Running and fixing tests

2. **Complex Problem Solving**
   - Research and documentation reading
   - Working through todo list methodically
   - Making steady progress even if slow

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Configuration**
   - Keep 60-second check interval for good coverage
   - Ensure Gemini API key is properly configured
   - Use `--no-guidance` flag for testing

2. **Cost Management**
   - Monitor daily API usage
   - Consider increasing interval during low-activity periods
   - Leverage caching by keeping monitor running continuously

3. **Future Improvements**
   - Add configurable stuck threshold (currently hardcoded at 20 turns)
   - Implement smarter pattern detection for specific stuck scenarios
   - Add metrics tracking for intervention accuracy

## Conclusion

These improvements significantly reduce false positive interventions while maintaining effective workflow compliance monitoring. The 73.7% cost reduction makes continuous monitoring much more affordable, and the clearer intervention criteria ensure the AI Monitor acts more like a helpful manager rather than an overly strict enforcer.
