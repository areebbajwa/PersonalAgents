Oral Immunotherapy (OIT) Information
- This document is intended for information only. It is not to be re-distributed or copied by any means.-
1. Oral immunotherapy in our clinic will be performed by a joint effort of Dr. Mack and Dr. Hanna.
2. OIT is not the standard of care for the management of food allergy. Many professional
organizations recommend avoidance strategies and feel that OIT is still considered experimental.
3. OIT is being offered by clinics in Canada, the United States and other parts of the world. OIT has
been included in some food allergy guidelines, although not in Canada.
4. The historic and current standard of care for food allergy is food avoidance and use of epinephrine
(eg. EpiPen) as necessary. Another alternative that is currently in clinical trials is called
Epicutaneous Immunotherapy, commonly known as the peanut or milk patch. This is not
commercially available at this time outside of a trial setting. Some clinics are performing food
allergy treatment trials in a research setting. We are not currently part of a trial.
5. Prior to beginning OIT, an oral challenge is an option that we support if parents or patients want
to either rule in or rule out their food allergy.
6. Most patients will be able to tolerate the target dose. This target may differ between patients.
OIT is generally effective if tolerated.
7. The long term benefits and risks of OIT are not fully understood at this time. A number of studies
have looked at patients after five or more years of OIT. These studies showed good overall
desensitization and potential development of true immune tolerance although tolerance may be
lost if patients discontinue the therapy.
8. This procedure is not without risk. Local and systemic reactions have occurred regularly. There
have been no fatalities reported although intensive care unit (ICU) stays have been reported.
9. Epinephrine (eg. EpiPen) use has been reported in research studies, in clinical practice and in our
own patients during clinic visits and at home.
10. A chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory condition called eosinophilic esophagitis has been
reported, however this typically resolves after cessation of therapy.
11. A potential risk with OIT is a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis. Symptoms of anaphylaxis
may include itchy rash, hives, facial swelling, wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, vomiting,
diarrhea, and in severe cases low blood pressure, loss of consciousness, and, rarely,
death. Medication, personnel and equipment are immediately available in the event of an
anaphylactic reaction if it occurs in our office. EMS (ambulance) transport to hospital may be
necessary.
12. Epinephrine should be used if concern about clinical reaction occur at home. An action plan will
be given outlining treatment for specific reactions, including the use of antihistamine, however,
if in doubt, epinephrine should be used.
13. Medications such as antihistamines, may be used to reduce symptoms if necessary.
14. Asthma control must be maintained and food doses may need to be changed if asthma control
worsens. Asthmatic patients are required to remain on a controller inhaler therapy (such as
Flovent or Alvesco) during the buildup and initial maintenance phase to reduce the potential for
severe reaction.
15. Buildup phase lasts between 6-12 months. Visits occur every 2 weeks during buildup. Buildup
phase clinic visits last 1-2 hours. Follow-up visits are every 6 – 12 months.
16. Commitment to daily dosing must be maintained.
17. Failing to continue to eat this food in the recommended quantities on a daily basis may result in
loss of the desensitized state and thus, an allergic reaction may occur if the food is eaten some
time later. Additionally, it may be necessary to start at the very beginning of desensitization if a
patient loses their desensitized state.
18. Doses must be given on a full stomach with food.
19. Exercise should be avoided for one hour prior to the dose and two hours after the dose, otherwise
an allergic reaction may occur.
20. During periods of illness, we will reduce the dose or hold the dosing if necessary as the risk of
reaction increases significantly during illness. We will not increase the dose if a patient comes to
our office for a dose increase and is sick.
21. Struggles that families face include, but are not limited to, reactions, recurrent illnesses, food
refusal, taste aversion, anxiety and long-term compliance.
22. Risk factors for reaction include, but are not limited to, illness, uncontrolled asthma, exercise,
missed doses and poor compliance with therapy and possibly environmental allergy exposure.
23. We still recommend that patients carry an EpiPen despite reaching maintenance therapy.
24. Daily allergenic food ingestion (eg. peanut or milk) may be ongoing and life-long at the end of
therapy. At this point we do not know if this is a cure.
25. If poor adherence to the clinic's oral immunotherapy plan occurs due to missed or forgotten
doses, or if Dr. Mack or Dr. Hanna feel that it is unsafe to continue the immunotherapy procedure,
participation will be stopped at the discretion of Dr. Mack or Dr. Hanna for the safety of the
patient.
26. Patients may be withdrawn if there is poor adherence to the treatment plan including asthma
management, poor asthma control, eosinophilic esophagitis, recurrent anaphylaxis or other
safety concerns.
27. Our clinic will make every attempt to contact or assess patients if there are concerns about
potential side effects or reactions as soon as possible. There may be times when it is impossible
for us to assess the patient, for example overnight, on weekends or when Dr. Mack or Dr. Hanna
are away.
28. OIT in Ontario is not a publicly funded procedure. This is similar to other countries. Our clinic
will bill patients directly for this service.
29. Patients are free to withdraw at any time with no consequences towards further care. In the
event a patient would like to resume oral immunotherapy it may be necessary to restart the
process. Patients may need to rejoin a waitlist prior to restarting and additional costs will be
incurred.

ORAL IMMUNOTHERAPY (OIT)
Financial Coverage Options
As an elective medical procedure, oral immunotherapy (OIT) for food is not covered by OHIP.
Patients may take a number of approaches to receive financial coverage for this procedure.
The following are suggested approaches for financial coverage of OIT. If you have private medical
insurance, the first two approaches may be applicable to you.
PRIVATE INSURANCE
The FIRST step is to approach the private insurance company with a letter from both yourself and
from our office requesting coverage for OIT. This is frequently initially rejected.
In the event your insurance rejects the initial request, the SECOND step, is to appeal to your
employer in a face-to-face meeting. This meeting should be with those individuals in your
company that deal with and manage medical benefits, such as Human Resources, or the owner
if it is a small company. If you are unionized, your union representative may also assist with this.
During this meeting, each family can make a personal case to the employer to request that the
employer consider adding OIT to their plan. The employer may then discuss and negotiate this
directly with the private insurer.
To date, we have had some employers cover the allergen suspension provided by the pharmacy.
HEALTH SPENDING ACCOUNT
The other approach successfully used by our patients is to utilize a health spending account or a
similar type of flexible spending account provided by your private insurance company.
For those that are incorporated or self-employed, Brock Health (www.brockhealth.ca) may be an
option.
FINANCING
Financing through a loan or credit line can be obtained through your bank or credit union. If
interested, we also have investigated the use of a private medical financing company, called
Medicard, www.medicard.com. Medicard specializes in financing medical procedures such as
fertility treatments, orthodontics and other private medical procedures. Please let us know if
you are interested in pursuing this type of financing.
We appreciate your feedback and welcome any questions or comments you may have.

viability of our practice and ensure prompt service, it is necessary (and legal) for our practice to
charge for these services.
All uninsured services must be paid in full when rendered. You have the right to receive a receipt
and our office staff will provide you with one upon settlement of your account. Should you be
unable to pay for the uninsured service at the time it is provided, please let the office staff know
when and how you intend to settle your outstanding account. We will make every effort possible
to assist you in the settlement of your outstanding account. Please note that our office accepts
Visa, MasterCard and Interac payments. Thank you for your co-operation.
Please acknowledge receipt and acceptance of the above office policy by signing below and
returning this form to our office. Should you have any further questions, please contact us at

This letter requests consideration to allow the addition of insurance coverage for Oral
Immunotherapy (OIT) for food allergy to your comprehensive employee health insurance plan.
Oral Immunotherapy is a publicly uninsured service offered across Canada for the treatment and
management of food allergies. We request that you review the following in consideration of
private coverage of this service that your employee is pursuing.
Over the past few decades, the incidence of allergic disease has increased with rates of food
allergy growing by two - three fold. As a result, rates of allergic reactions and hospitalizations
for anaphylaxis have also risen tremendously. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can
lead to significant breathing difficulty, loss of consciousness and even cardiac arrest. Even the
accidental ingestion of a very small amount of food that a person is allergic to can lead to a severe
or fatal reaction. Fatal anaphylaxis is a preventable tragedy and significant allergic reactions
requiring epinephrine occur on a routine basis in patients with food allergy. The quality of life in
families who experience food allergy is typically greatly impaired. Until recently, management of
food allergy simply consisted of avoidance strategies and epinephrine prescriptions.
Oral food desensitization, more commonly called OIT, allows a food allergic patient to tolerate
increasing amounts of the food that they are allergic to, such as peanut or milk. The process and
theory behind this is very similar to subcutaneous or sublingual immunotherapy for insect venom
or environmental allergies. Gradually over a period of 6 - 8 months, the dose ingested by the
patient is increased until they are able to eat a typical serving of that food. More than 85% of
patients who start this therapy successfully tolerate significant amounts of the food they are
allergic to.
During OIT, immunologic changes occur suggesting the development of true tolerance, and after
successful treatment, the majority are able to consume the food of concern on an ad lib basis.
This process was first described approximately 100 years ago and it has been rigorously evaluated
over the past 25 years. Multiple randomized, controlled and blinded trials have been performed
and published over the past decade. Two Phase 2 trials have been published for peanut OIT with
a recent high-powered randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial reported for
peanut allergy.
This Phase 3 trial confirmed that patients that had completed OIT were able to safely ingest
significant amounts of peanut with little to no reaction whatsoever. As well, it showed
significantly reduced epinephrine (EpiPen) use in the setting of an allergic reaction and any
potential reaction was much milder than in those patients that had not undergone OIT. Health
Canada and FDA approval are pending.
Importantly, for many of our families, quality of life also improves significantly. This is confirmed
in multiple studies that have evaluated the psychosocial burden of food allergy and OIT. Oral
Immunotherapy reduces the concern about accidental ingestion, and families are able to live
normal lives - attending birthday parties, travelling, and even eating at regular restaurants.
Specialist allergy clinics offer this therapy across North America and in other countries, and over
8000 patients have been treated in Japan alone. Many insurance providers in the United States
currently provide coverage for patients to receive Oral Food Desensitization. Multiple countries,
and more recently the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, have written
consensus guidelines suggesting OIT as an effective treatment option for the management of
food allergy. In fact, this most recent guideline gave OIT the strongest recommendation possible.
North American guidelines are also in the works and Dr. Mack is privileged to be involved in this
endeavour.
Unfortunately, provincial health plans do not cover this therapy across Canada, and this is
considered in Ontario to be an uninsured service. As such, we, as leaders in the field of Allergy
and Immunology, request that companies such as your own fund patients who would like to
pursue Oral Food Desensitization for their life-threatening food allergies.
Please consider adding this option to your employee health insurance plans.
Relevant studies are referenced below. If you have any further questions in the care of this
patient, please contact our office directly.
Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

ORAL CHALLENGE INFORMATION
Because of the involved and extended nature of the challenge, if you are running more than 15
minutes late, we will not be able to start the oral challenge.
An oral challenge is not without risk and reactions are possible, both mild and severe, as we are giving
a product that your child may be allergic to. We try to make this as safe as possible and recommend
the following:
Please do not come for oral challenge if your child is sick at all or has poor asthma control. Call
to cancel instead. Your child must be perfectly healthy at the time of the challenge.
Please take no antihistamines or cold medication for 7 days prior to the oral challenge.
Please DO take your regular asthma medications.
Please BRING all your regular medications including asthma medication and 2 Epipens.
Please bring the food or medication required for the challenge. We will not typically provide food.
