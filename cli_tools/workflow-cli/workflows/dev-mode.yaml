    title: "Consult Knowledge Base"
    content: |
      **⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is research phase - DO NOT implement anything yet.**
      
      Execute these research steps:
      
      **Local Context:**
      1. Search codebase for similar implementations
      2. Find existing code to reuse/extend (prioritize ai_cache_utils.js for AI calls)
      3. Check config/.env for existing API keys before asking user
      4. Search ~/PersonalAgents/todos/ directory for previous learnings
      
      **Web Context:**
      5. Search web for best practices on the technology/framework
      6. Find latest API documentation
      7. Look for common patterns and pitfalls
      8. Check for batch operation support in APIs

    title: "Apply Musk's 5-Step Process"
    content: |
      **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Still in planning phase - NO implementation yet.**
      
      **CRITICAL:** Review Non-Negotiable User Requirements from todo file - NEVER violate these when simplifying.
      
      Apply this analysis to the current task:
      1. Question: Is this requirement necessary?
      2. Delete: What can we remove?
      3. Simplify: How can we make it simpler?
      4. Accelerate: Speed up only after simplifying
      5. Automate: Automate only proven processes
      
      Example:
      - User wants caching → Do ALL endpoints need it?
      - Can we use in-memory instead of Redis?
      - Test the simple solution first

      **NOW YOU CAN START IMPLEMENTATION!**
      
      Execute these implementation steps:
      1. Work through your todo list from step 5
      2. Write one logical unit of functionality
      3. Write E2E test for that functionality
      4. Run test and verify it passes
      5. After test passes → `workflow-cli --project [project-name] --sub-task-next`
      6. Update todo file with progress and timestamps
      7. ONLY if passed → Move to next feature
      
      **Remember:**
      - Update timestamps in format [HH:MM] for each task/note
      - Mark completed tasks with ✅
      - Log breakthroughs with 🔥 BREAKTHROUGH
      - MUST complete entire todo list autonomously
      - Never give up, keep trying until done

      **Git Status Cleanup:**
      1. Run `git status` and review all changes
      2. Check Non-Negotiable User Requirements from todo file
      3. Remove any code/tools/scripts/tests NOT relevant to requirements:
         - Unneeded helper scripts
         - Test files for removed features
         - Documentation for deleted functionality
      4. Update/delete conflicting docs/references in other files based on changes

         git checkout -- cli_tools todos  # Discard symlink changes
         cd ../..

global_rules:
  - title: "Core Principles"
    content: |
      1. Simplify ruthlessly, test what matters
      2. Never proceed with failing tests
      3. Use batch APIs instead of loops
      4. Check existing code/todos first
      5. Ask before commits/final submissions
      6. Update ~/PersonalAgents/todos/YYYYMMDD-[project]-todo.md with timestamps in format: [HH:MM] using ✅🕒🔥
      7. MUST complete entire todo list autonomously - never stop until done (only ask for help if stuck on 2FA)
      8. NEVER take shortcuts when completing todo list - fix whatever is broken as needed so future tasks are easier
      9. NEVER mark todo items complete hastily - if you realize you marked something complete prematurely, immediately undo it
      10. Search the web as needed for documentation and solutions
      11. Keep directory structure clean: place new files in appropriate directories (cli_tools/, tests/, docs/, data/, scripts/, etc.)
      12. ALWAYS read debug logs before attempting any fix - never make blind fixes
      13. If dealing with anything GUI related, take screenshots regularly to understand what's going on
      14. NO FALLBACK CODE - Keep logic simple and direct, avoid complex fallback patterns
      15. ALWAYS find root cause of issues and fix it - never add band-aid fixes or fallbacks
      16. Use GitHub/npm libraries instead of reinventing the wheel - search for existing solutions first
      17. If stuck after significant effort and things are messy - first search web for best practices, then simplify and rebuild from scratch instead of fixing broken code
      18. Never duplicate any code or create any redundancy. Update/delete/refactor as needed.

        - reason: "The 'plan' step will re-evaluate the plan with the new requirements"
      ```


  - title: "Never Do"
    content: |
      - NEVER proceed with failing tests
      - NEVER mark complete without E2E testing
      - NEVER mark todo items complete hastily - undo immediately if done prematurely
      - NEVER attempt fixes without reading debug logs first
      - NEVER try to fix GUI issues without taking screenshots
      - NEVER add band-aid fixes or fallbacks - always find and fix root cause
      - NEVER take shortcuts when completing todo list - fix problems properly
      - NEVER give up - find another way

  - title: "Terminal Command Limits"
    content: |
      - Commands timeout after 2 minutes - run long tasks in background: `cmd > /tmp/log.txt 2>&1 &`
      - Never use sleep > 119 seconds

  - title: "Automation Tools"
    content: |
      - Check available MCP tools and resources
      - Use official APIs first, selenium-cli browser only for unsupported features
      - selenium-cli browser: unblock auth, get API keys, one-time setup tasks
      - Take screenshots when curious/stuck: screenshot-cli tool
      - Use record-cli to record screen and send to AI for analysis if screenshots don't suffice
      - Last resort for GUI tasks: desktop-automation-cli
