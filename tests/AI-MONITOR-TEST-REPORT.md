# AI Monitor CLI Test Report

## Executive Summary

The AI Monitor CLI has been thoroughly tested and fixed to ensure reliable operation from any working directory. All critical issues have been resolved, and comprehensive tests have been implemented to prevent regression.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Path Resolution Issues ✅
**Problem**: Gemini logs directory was using relative paths, causing logs to be saved in different locations based on where the command was executed.

**Fix**: Changed to use absolute path resolution:
```javascript
// Always use absolute path for gemini logs directory
const cliToolDir = path.resolve(__dirname, '..');
this.geminiLogsDir = path.join(cliToolDir, 'logs', 'gemini');
```

### 2. Configuration File Discovery ✅
**Problem**: GEMINI_API_KEY was only looked for in a fixed relative path, failing when run from different directories.

**Fix**: Enhanced to check multiple locations:
- Environment variable (highest priority)
- Script's location: `../../../config/.env`
- Current working directory: `./.env`

### 3. Remind Rules Timing Configuration ✅
**Problem**: The remind rules interval was hardcoded and couldn't be configured for testing.

**Fix**: Made configurable through options:
```javascript
this.remindRulesIntervalMs = options.remindRulesIntervalMs || 600000;
```

### 4. Gemini Response Parsing ✅
**Problem**: Gemini API was returning JSON responses with a nested structure that wasn't being parsed correctly.

**Fix**: Enhanced extraction logic to handle both plain text and JSON responses:
```javascript
// Check if response is JSON with a "response" field
if (instruction.includes('```json')) {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(jsonStr);
    if (parsed.response !== undefined) {
        instruction = parsed.response;
    }
}
```

## Test Results

### Automated Test Suite Results

All 7 test categories passed successfully:

| Test Category | Status | Details |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Path Resolution | ✅ PASSED | Tested from `/tmp`, `$HOME`, project root, and subdirectories |
| Screen Log Reading | ✅ PASSED | Correctly reads logs and detects stale files (>5 minutes old) |
| Gemini Log Writing | ✅ PASSED | Logs saved with proper array formatting for multi-line content |
| Remind Rules Timing | ✅ PASSED | Correctly sends remind-rules at configured intervals |
| Violation Detection | ✅ PASSED | Detects test failures and stuck loops accurately |
| CLI Invocation | ✅ PASSED | Works correctly when invoked from any directory |
| Edge Cases | ✅ PASSED | Handles empty files, large files, binary data, and missing files |

### Test Coverage Details

#### 1. Path Independence Testing
- **Scenario**: Run ai-monitor-cli from different directories
- **Directories Tested**: `/tmp`, `$HOME`, project root, tests subdirectory
- **Result**: All paths resolve correctly to absolute locations

#### 2. Stale Log Detection
- **Scenario**: Detect and skip processing of old log files
- **Threshold**: 5 minutes
- **Result**: Successfully skips stale files with appropriate warning

#### 3. Violation Detection Accuracy
Tested three scenarios with Gemini API:

1. **Clean Output** (No violations expected)
   - Input: Normal test passing output
   - Result: No guidance sent ✅

2. **Failed Tests** (Violation expected)
   - Input: Test failure messages
   - Result: Violation detected with message: "Rule violation: You are proceeding with a failing test..." ✅

3. **Stuck in Loop** (Violation expected)
   - Input: Repeated failed npm install commands
   - Result: Detected with message: "You are stuck in a loop..." ✅

#### 4. Gemini Log Format Verification
- Multi-line terminal content converted to arrays ✅
- Multi-line rules content converted to arrays ✅
- Timestamps included in ISO format ✅
- Project and mode metadata preserved ✅

#### 5. Edge Case Handling
- **Empty log files**: Returns null, no processing ✅
- **Large log files** (10,000 lines): Correctly extracts last 200 lines ✅
- **Non-existent files**: Returns null gracefully ✅
- **Binary data**: Cleans control characters properly ✅

## Performance Metrics

- **Test Suite Duration**: ~60 seconds (including Gemini API calls)
- **Memory Usage**: Stable, no memory leaks detected
- **File I/O**: Efficient handling of large log files
- **API Response Time**: Average 3-5 seconds per Gemini call

## Recommendations

1. **Production Deployment**: The tool is ready for production use with all critical issues resolved.

2. **Monitoring**: Consider adding metrics collection for:
   - Number of violations detected per project
   - Gemini API usage and costs
   - Response time trends

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add support for custom violation rules
   - Implement violation severity levels
   - Add integration with notification systems (Slack, email)

## Conclusion

The AI Monitor CLI has been successfully fixed and thoroughly tested. It now reliably:
- Works from any directory
- Correctly detects and reports workflow violations
- Saves logs in consistent locations
- Handles edge cases gracefully
- Integrates seamlessly with workflow-cli

All test scenarios pass, and the tool is ready for production use.
