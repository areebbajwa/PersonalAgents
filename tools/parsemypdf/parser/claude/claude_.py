PDF Content Extraction and Question Answering Script using Claude API

This script leverages Anthropic's Claude API to process PDF documents, extract content, and answer 
specific questions about the content. It handles various PDF formats including complex layouts, 
tables, and image-based content, providing accurate question-answering capabilities.

Key Features:
    - Extracts and structures content from PDFs while preserving formatting
    - Processes both text-based and image-based content
    - Converts tables to markdown format
    - Provides focused answers to specific questions about PDF content
    - Handles multiple PDF formats (standard tables, image-based tables, complex layouts)
    - Supports base64 encoding for secure PDF transmission

Dependencies:
    - anthropic: For interacting with Claude API
    - python-dotenv: For environment variable management
    - base64 (standard library): For PDF encoding
    - os (standard library): For environment variable access

Required Environment Variables:
    - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: API key for authenticating with Anthropic's services

Usage:
    Place PDF files in the 'input/' directory and set up environment variables.
    The script can process various types of PDFs:
    - sample-1.pdf: Contains standard tables
    - sample-2.pdf: Contains image-based simple tables
    - sample-3.pdf: Contains image-based complex tables
    - sample-4.pdf: Complex PDF with mixed content (text and tables in images)
    - sample-5.pdf: Multi-column Texts 

Note: Uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet model with PDF beta feature for optimal extraction
