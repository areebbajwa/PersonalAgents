# Interac e-Transfer Tracking Workflow

This rule documents the process for tracking Interac e-Transfers between TD Bank and Google Sheets.

## Process Overview

1. Log into TD Canada Trust EasyWeb at https://authentication.td.com. Use 123mxypkwj as the password.
2. Navigate to Interac e-Transfer → History → Money Received tab
3. View all received e-Transfers (use "Show more" to see everything)
4. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the Transfers sheet to see the most recent entries
5. Compare TD transfers with the latest entries in Google Sheets
6. Generate a simple copy-pastable list of transfers not yet recorded

## Response Format

When asked to process e-Transfers, simply provide a ready-to-paste list in this format:
DD/MM/YYYY Name Amount Email/Mobile Autodeposited
DD/MM/YYYY Name Amount Email/Mobile Autodeposited

Do not attempt to automate through browser interactions. Instead, focus on:
1. Analyzing visible transfers
2. Comparing with visible spreadsheet entries
3. Providing a clean, formatted list of missing transfers
4. Using exact names from the Commitments sheet, not the all-caps TD names

## Name Matching

Names in TD often appear in all caps (like "MUHAMMAD ALI JABBAR") and should be matched with the proper case names from the Commitments sheet for consistency in tracking.
