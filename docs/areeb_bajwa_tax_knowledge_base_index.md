## 3. **CRA Audit/Review Triggers & Risk Management**

* Historical late filing, balances, and arrears interest (now paid).
* High donations and medical claims reduced to "safe" levels.
* Child care claim removed for 2023 to avoid review (low spouse income).
* T5 slip from Mpyre not previously filed for 2021/2022, did not trigger review but increases cross-match risk.

* Consistent address and ID info on all filings.

## 4. **Mpyre Software Inc. (BN 807356423)**

* **Corporate structure:** Sole shareholder (you).
* **T2 Corporate Returns:** Only filed up to 2019; **2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 outstanding** as of May 2025.
* **T5 Slips:** None filed (for 2021â€“2023), despite personal dividends reported.

  * **Action required:** File 2023 T5 slip ASAP (plus any prior slips if dividends were paid).
  * T5 late-filing penalty: \$25/day, capped at \$2,500 per slip; interest compounds daily.
* **GRIP balance as of 2019:** \$1,654,048 (General Rate Income Pool; capacity for eligible dividends).

  * 2023 dividend (\$84,593) is <5% of GRIP, so penalty risk is zero if reported properly.
  * 2020â€“2023 T2s must be filed with Schedule 53 to update the GRIP balance for CRA.
* **Account Balances:** No corporate tax, GST/HST, or payroll balances currently owing. Large \$11,920 CR carry-back on 2014-12-31 period-end, will offset penalties.
* **CRA Mail:** Multiple "Demand to file T2" letters (2022â€“2024); missing returns subject to late-filing penalties (max \$2,500/yr).
* **No penalties/interest posted yet** (will be assessed retroactively when filed).
* **No T5 penalty or gross negligence letters yet, but at risk.**

---

## 5. **Corporate Compliance/Consequences**

* Penalties for late T2 and T5 filings are already at max; **interest is compounding daily**.
* Ignoring filings longer increases:

  * Compounded interest (\~\$4/day across all penalties)
  * Risk of arbitrary CRA assessment (estimated high, wipes out credits)
  * Possibility of director liability if company doesn't pay
  * Remote risk of prosecution after multiple demand-to-file notices.
* Potential for forced corporate dissolution if not kept up to date.

---

## 6. **Dividend Taxation & Planning**

* Eligible dividends up to GRIP balance (\$1.5M+) can be paid at lower personal rates (but high amounts push you into top tax brackets, triggering \~39% marginal rate).
* AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax) now affects large dividend payouts starting in 2024.
* Must always file T5 before/with T1 return to avoid audit triggers.
* Salary vs. dividend strategy: salary builds RRSP room and CPP, is deductible for corp; dividends use up GRIP, taxed personally, no payroll needed.

---

## 7. **TFSA/Other Investment Issues**

* 2023: Over-contribution to TFSA, assessed 1%/month penalty; penalty and arrears interest paid as of March 2025.
* Excess withdrawn (assumed); details not available during portal outage.

## 8. **Recommended Filing/Compliance Sequence**

1. **File 2023 T5 slip** for eligible dividends from Mpyre ASAP.
2. File 2020â€“2023 T2 corporate returns (oldest to newest), with Schedule 53 for GRIP continuity.
3. If dividends were paid in 2020â€“2022, file T5s for those years.
4. Optionally, submit everything together via Voluntary Disclosures Program (VDP) to seek interest relief.
5. Re-run CRA Auto-fill and file 2023 personal T1 (with T5 now on file).
6. Attach a note to T1 explaining dividend, HELOC living expenses, and status of corporate filings.
7. Pay any remaining corporate or personal tax, penalty, or interest balances after credits are applied.
8. Keep all documentation, slips, working papers, and bank statements for 6 years.
