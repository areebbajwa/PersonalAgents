## Major Signs of the Day of Judgment

According to Sahih Muslim, Hudhaifa b. Usaid al-Ghifari reported that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: "It will not come until you see ten signs before and (in this connection) he made a mention of:

### 1. The Smoke (Ad-Dukhan)
The Smoke is mentioned both in the Quran and in authentic hadith as one of the major signs. It will be a clear supernatural event that will affect people globally.

### 2. The Dajjal (Antichrist)
- He will appear between Syria and Iraq and will move towards Damascus
- He will claim divinity
- The word "Kafir" (disbeliever) will be inscribed between his eyes
- He will be blind in his right eye
- He will be followed by 70,000 Jews from Isfahan (present-day Iran)
- He will remain on earth for forty days
- He will perform false miracles - kill people and bring them back to life, command the sky to rain, and the earth to produce crops
- He will travel across the earth, entering every city except Makkah and Madinah, which will be protected by angels

### 3. The Beast (Dabbat al-Ard)
When the Beast comes, it will distinguish the people and declare who is a believer and who is a disbeliever. Ahmad recorded that the Prophet said: "The beast will appear and he will brand the people on their noses."

### 4. The Rising of the Sun from the West
This is one of the most significant signs, as it will mark the closing of the door of repentance. Once the sun rises from the west, no one's faith will be accepted if they didn't believe before that moment.

### 5. The Descent of 'Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus, peace be upon him)
- He will descend from the heavens to the white minaret in the east of Damascus
- He will be wearing two garments slightly dyed with Saffron
- His hands will be placed on the wings of two angels
- Every disbeliever who smells his breath will die, and his breath will reach as far as he can see
- He will kill the Dajjal at the Eastern gate of Ludd (Lod in present-day Israel)
- He will pray behind the Mahdi
- He will break the cross, kill the swine, and abolish the jizya
- He will remain on earth for forty years

### 6. The Appearance of Ya'juj and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog)
- Allah will reveal to 'Isa: "I have released slaves of Mine whom no one will be able to fight. Take My slaves to safety in al-Tur (Sinai)"
- They will come swarming down from every mound
- They will drink up all the water of Lake Tiberias
- They will be destroyed by worms in their necks sent by Allah

### 7. Three Major Landslides
There will be three landslides before Qiyamah like never seen before:
- One in the East
- One in the West  
- One in Arabia
The Earth will swallow everything above it and as a result, many people will die. These landslides will be of much greater magnitude and severity than ordinary landslides.

### 8. The Fire from Yemen
This is the last of the major signs. The fire will come out from Yemen and will drive people to their place of assembly. According to the hadith: "at the end of which fire would burn forth from the Yemen, and would drive people to the place of their assembly."

## The Mahdi (Appears Before the Major Signs)
While not listed among the ten major signs in the hadith of Hudhaifa, the Mahdi's appearance is significant:
- He will be from the lineage of Fatimah, daughter of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)
- His name will be Muhammad, and his father's name will be Abdullah
- He will closely resemble the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)
- He will appear when there is extreme violence, confusion and disputes
- He will fill the earth with justice and equity after it had been filled with oppression and tyranny
- He will rule for seven years
- The conquest of Constantinople will occur during his time

## Order of Events

The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "The signs will come one after another, like beads falling from a string" [Abu Hurayrah]. However, the exact chronological order is not definitively established in the hadith, though scholars have attempted to determine a likely sequence:

1. The appearance of the Mahdi
2. The emergence of the Dajjal
3. The descent of 'Isa (Jesus) ﷺ
4. The killing of the Dajjal by 'Isa ﷺ
5. The emergence of Ya'juj and Ma'juj
6. The destruction of Ya'juj and Ma'juj
7. The other major signs following in quick succession

## Important Notes

1. **Authenticity**: These signs are mentioned in various authentic hadith collections, particularly in Sahih Muslim and Sahih Bukhari, and have been described by numerous medieval Muslim scholars, including al-Ghazali, Ibn Kathir, and Muhammad al-Bukhari.

2. **Timing**: Muslim scholars have different views concerning the order of the signs because no definitive chronological order is narrated in the Sunnah.

3. **Sources**: For detailed study with complete hadith references, scholars recommend:
   - "Al-Qiyamah al-Sughra" by Shaykh 'Umar Sulayman al-Ashqar (available in English as "The Minor Resurrection")
   - "Ashrat al-Sa'ah" by Shaykh Yusuf al-Wabil
   - "The Signs Before the Day of Judgment" by Ibn Kathir

4. **Current Status**: The majority of the minor signs have appeared, while some are occurring and some will appear with major signs. None of the major signs have yet occurred.

5. **Purpose**: These signs serve as reminders for believers to prepare for the Hereafter and to strengthen their faith before the Day of Judgment arrives.
