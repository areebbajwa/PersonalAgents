## Key Calculations for 2023 Eligible Dividends (Federal):

*   **Gross-up:** Actual eligible dividend amount * 1.38 = Taxable amount of eligible dividends (Box 25).
*   **Federal Dividend Tax Credit:** Taxable amount of eligible dividends (Box 25) * 0.150198 = Dividend tax credit for eligible dividends (Box 26).

This process is subject to change by the CRA. Always refer to the latest CRA guidelines.
