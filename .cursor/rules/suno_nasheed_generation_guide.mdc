# Suno AI Nasheed Generation Guide

This guide outlines the process for generating nasheeds using the Suno AI website (https://suno.com/create). Element references on this site appear to be dynamic, so it's crucial to take a browser snapshot before interacting with elements to get their current references.

## Process:

1.  **Navigate to Suno:**
    *   Go to `https://suno.com/create`.

2.  **Take Initial Snapshot:**
    *   Use the browser tool to take a snapshot of the page. This will provide the initial references for the input fields and buttons.

3.  **For Each Nasheed:**

    a.  **Get Current Element References (Crucial):**
        *   Before each set of interactions for a new song (or if an interaction fails), take a new snapshot to ensure you have the latest element references. The references can change after interactions or page updates.

    b.  **Identify Key Elements from Snapshot:**
        *   Lyrics Textbox (e.g., look for "Add your own lyrics here")
        *   Style Description Textbox (e.g., look for "Enter style description")
        *   Song Title Textbox (e.g., look for "Enter song title")
        *   Create Button
        *   Clear All Button (usually appears after some input or creation attempt)

    c.  **Input Lyrics:**
        *   Use the browser tool to type the nasheed lyrics into the identified **Lyrics Textbox**.

    d.  **Input Style:**
        *   Use the browser tool to type the style (e.g., "Pop, male vocals only accapella") into the identified **Style Description Textbox**. Always only use halal instruments. 

    e.  **Input Title:**
        *   Use the browser tool to type the song title into the identified **Song Title Textbox**.

    f.  **Click Create:**
        *   Use the browser tool to click the identified **Create Button**.

    g.  **Wait for Generation (Context-Dependent):**
        *   The site will start generating the song. You don't need to wait for each song to complete before starting the next.

    h.  **Clear Fields for Next Song:**
        *   Take a snapshot if unsure about the "Clear All" button's reference.
        *   Use the browser tool to click the identified **Clear All Button** to prepare for the next nasheed.

4.  **Repeat:**
    *   Repeat step 3 for all nasheeds to be generated.

## Important Notes:

*   **Dynamic Element References:** Element references (`ref` values like `s1e172`, `s23e209`) change frequently. Always use a fresh snapshot to get the correct `ref` before an interaction.
*   **Error Handling:** If a step fails (e.g., typing into a field), it's often due to a changed element reference. Take a new snapshot, get the correct reference, and retry. Clearing fields and retrying the entire entry for that song can also be a valid strategy.
