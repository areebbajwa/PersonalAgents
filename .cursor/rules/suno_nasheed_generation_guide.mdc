**Rule Set: Halal Nasheed Generation with Islamic Figures Education (Optimized)**

**Objective:** Generate unique nasheeds on Suno AI, each focusing on a different, lesser-known Islamic historical figure (scholars, prophets, companions, etc.). Each nasheed should be in a popular Western music style but utilize *only* pre-determined halal-permissible instruments. Provide a brief educational summary of each figure after initiating their nasheed's generation.

**Assumed Knowledge:**
*   **Halal Instruments:** The AI has a working list of permissible instruments (e.g., duff, daf, various hand percussion, vocals, and accepted synthesized sounds mimicking these or neutral tones like synth pads/melodies, drum machines programmed for appropriate rhythms).

**Phase 1: Initial Setup**

1.  **Navigate to Suno AI:**
    *   **Action:** Use the browser navigation tool to go to `https://suno.com/create`.
    *   **Goal:** Access the nasheed creation interface.

**Phase 2: Nasheed Generation Cycle (Repeat 20 times for 20 unique figures/nasheeds)**

*For each iteration, ensure a new Islamic figure and a varied Western musical style are chosen.*

1.  **Select Islamic Figure & Theme:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Choose a lesser-known but significant Islamic figure (e.g., scholars like Imam Abu Hanifa, Al-Ghazali, Ibn Sina; companions like Al-Khansa, Zayd ibn Harithah, Asma bint Abi Bakr, Sumayyah bint Khabbat, Mus'ab ibn Umayr, Bilal ibn Rabah, Salman al-Farsi, Abu Bakr, Umar; other figures like Fatima al-Fihri, Mariyah al-Qibtiyya, Rabia al-Adawiyya, Salahuddin Al-Ayyubi). *Maintain a list of used figures to ensure uniqueness.*
        *   Develop a central theme for the nasheed based on the figure's life, contributions, or key characteristics.
    *   **Goal:** Define the subject and core message of the nasheed.
2.  **Compose Lyrics:**
    *   **Action:** Write 3-4 short stanzas of lyrics that are respectful, informative, and suitable for a nasheed about the chosen figure and theme.
    *   **Goal:** Create the textual content for the nasheed.
3.  **Define Style & Instrumentation:**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Choose a popular Western music style (e.g., Folk, Pop, Epic Cinematic, Chillwave, Lo-fi Hip Hop, R&B, Soft Acoustic, Reggae, Country, Blues, Indie Folk, Jazz Fusion, Soulful Gospel, Dream Pop, Indie Pop, Spoken Word, World Music with regional influences, Classic Rock, Rock Opera). *Vary the style for each nasheed.*
        *   Formulate a style description string. This string *must* include:
            *   The chosen Western style.
            *   Vocal description (e.g., "male vocals," "female vocals," "choir").
            *   Explicit mention of *only known* halal instruments (e.g., "duff (frame drum)," "hand percussion," "hand claps," "darbuka," "tombak," "setar," "synth melodies," "synth pads," "drum machine").
            *   Keywords like "spiritual," "devotional," "inspiring," "educational," "heartfelt," "reflective," etc., as appropriate.
            *   The phrase "halal instruments only."
    *   **Goal:** Define the musical character of the nasheed, strictly adhering to pre-determined halal principles.
4.  **Create Song Title:**
    *   **Action:** Formulate a concise and relevant title for the nasheed.
    *   **Goal:** Provide an identifier for the song.
5.  **Input into Suno AI:**
    *   **Action:** Using browser interaction tools (type, click):
        *   Take a snapshot if element references are stale or uncertain.
        *   Input the composed lyrics into the "Lyrics textbox."
        *   Input the formulated style description into the "Style Description textbox."
        *   Input the song title into the "Song Title textbox."
    *   **Goal:** Populate the Suno AI form with the nasheed details.
6.  **Generate Nasheed:**
    *   **Action:** Click the "Create" button.
    *   **Goal:** Initiate the AI music generation process.
7.  **Educate on the Figure:**
    *   **Action:** While the nasheed is generating, provide a brief (2-4 sentences) summary of the chosen Islamic figure, highlighting their significance, key contributions, or story.
    *   **Goal:** Fulfill the educational component of the task.
8.  **Clear Form for Next Nasheed:**
    *   **Action:** After confirming the nasheed generation has started (e.g., it appears in the generation queue or library list):
        *   Take a snapshot if element references are stale or uncertain.
        *   Click the "Clear All" button on the Suno AI interface.
    *   **Goal:** Prepare the form for the next iteration.

**Phase 3: Completion**

1.  **Confirmation:** After 20 nasheeds are initiated, confirm that the task is complete.
2.  **Offer Next Steps:** Ask the user if they need anything else, such as a list of the generated nasheeds or further assistance.

**Important Considerations for the AI Assistant:**

*   **Element Reference Management:** Be prepared for Suno AI's interface elements (button/textbox refs) to change. If a click/type action fails due to a stale reference, immediately take a new snapshot and update the references before retrying.
*   **Halal Instrument Adherence:** Strictly adhere to the *known list* of halal instruments.
*   **Variety:** Actively track and vary the Islamic figures chosen and the Western musical styles applied to ensure diversity across the 20 nasheeds.
*   **Error Handling (Implicit):** If Suno AI encounters an error or a nasheed fails to generate, note it and attempt to regenerate that specific nasheed or move to the next figure, ensuring 20 successful initiations.
*   **User Interaction:** Keep the user informed of progress, especially when starting a new nasheed and providing the educational summary.
