          "display": "Areeb, the freeze is not coming from Google at all—it’s Playwright itself.\nHere’s the straight-shot explanation, then the most reliable path to get you moving.\n\n---\n\n### What’s actually freezing\n\n* Playwright relies on a **patched build** of Firefox.\n  The vanilla `/Applications/Firefox.app/...` binary does not speak Playwright’s private “Juggler” protocol, so the browser exits the moment it sees the `-juggler-pipe` flag and MCP sits there forever waiting for a handshake. The Playwright docs are blunt: “Playwright doesn’t work with the branded version of Firefox since it relies on patches; use at your own risk.” ([stackoverflow.com][1], [playwright.dev][2])\n\n* Using the patched build gets you past the freeze, but Google’s login service flags that test build as “unsafe.” That’s why the direct login flow is impossible.\n\nSo you have two realistic options:\n\n1. keep Playwright’s patched Firefox and **inject a working cookie jar**;\n2. switch to a driver that can talk to real Firefox (geckodriver/Selenium) and accept the heavier stack.\n\nI’ll focus on the first, because it’s the lightest change to your MCP setup.\n\n---\n\n### Why your first cookie export failed\n\nFirefox stores cookies in `cookies.sqlite`. Your quick Python dump probably left out three fields Playwright needs:\n\n* `sameSite` (Firefox uses integers 0 / 1 / 2, Playwright wants `'None'`, `'Lax'`, `'Strict'`)\n* `expiry` must be an **integer** (`Number`), not a string\n* The JSON envelope must be `{ \"cookies\": […], \"origins\": [] }`\n\nIf any cookie is malformed (string where number expected, missing field, wrong sameSite value), Playwright silently skips it, and Google then treats you as signed-out.\n\n---\n\n### One-time script that **clones your real profile, converts every Google cookie, and writes a fully-valid storage-state file**\n\nSave this as `export-google-cookies.js` and run with Node. Adjust the two paths at the top.\n\n```js\n// adapt these:\nconst FF_PROFILE = '/Users/areeb2/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/1nykysv3.default-release';\nconst OUT_FILE   = '/Users/areeb2/google-firefox.json';\n\nconst { Database } = require('better-sqlite3');\nconst path = require('path');\nconst fs   = require('fs');\n\n// 1-copy cookies.sqlite so Firefox isn’t locking it\nconst tmp = '/tmp/ff-cookies.sqlite';\nfs.copyFileSync(path.join(FF_PROFILE, 'cookies.sqlite'), tmp);\n\n// 2-read every Google-family cookie\nconst db   = new Database(tmp, { readonly: true });\nconst rows = db.prepare(`\n  SELECT name, value, host, path, expiry, isSecure, isHttpOnly, sameSite\n  FROM   moz_cookies\n  WHERE  host LIKE '%google.%'\n`).all();\n\n// 3-translate Firefox → Playwright format\nconst SAME_SITE = ['None', 'Lax', 'Strict'];\nconst cookies   = rows.map(r => ({\n  name:      r.name,\n  value:     r.value,\n  domain:    r.host,\n  path:      r.path,\n  expires:   Number(r.expiry),        // integer!\n  httpOnly:  !!r.isHttpOnly,\n  secure:    !!r.isSecure,\n  sameSite:  SAME_SITE[r.sameSite] || 'None'\n}));\n\n// 4-write storage-state file\nfs.writeFileSync(OUT_FILE, JSON.stringify({ cookies, origins: [] }, null, 2));\nconsole.log(`✅ wrote ${cookies.length} cookies to ${OUT_FILE}`);\n```\n\nRun:\n\n```bash\nnode export-google-cookies.js\n```\n\nYou’ll see something like “✅ wrote 42 cookies to /Users/areeb2/google-firefox.json”.\n\n---\n\n### Point MCP at the patched Firefox **and** this storage file\n\n```json5\n\"playwright\": {\n  \"type\": \"stdio\",\n  \"command\": \"/Users/areeb2/.nvm/versions/node/v22.15.1/bin/npx\",\n  \"args\": [\n    \"@playwright/mcp@latest\",\n    \"--browser\", \"firefox\",\n    \"--storage-state\", \"/Users/areeb2/google-firefox.json\",\n    \"--user-data-dir\", \"/Users/areeb2/.pwt-google-ff\"   // any empty folder\n  ],\n  \"env\": {}\n}\n```\n\n* Don’t pass `--executable-path` – let MCP launch the **patched** browser it ships with.\n* Keep it **headed** for the first runs; once you confirm Gmail loads, you can add `--headless` if you want.\n\n---\n\n### When the cookies expire\n\nGoogle’s SID/HSID/LSID cookies last \\~30 days. To refresh:\n\n1. launch real Firefox, sign back in if needed;\n2. re-run `export-google-cookies.js`;\n3. restart MCP.\n\nNo manual Playwright login ever needed.\n\n---\n\n### If you absolutely must drive the **real** Firefox / Safari\n\nMove to geckodriver+Selenium (or DevTools-over-CDP for Chrome). Playwright MCP cannot, by design, attach to the unpatched binaries. That’s a tooling constraint, not a bug.\n\n---\n\nTry the conversion script and patched-Firefox run above. If Gmail still doesn’t come up authenticated, grab the MCP console log and the first 15 lines of `google-firefox.json` and we’ll pinpoint the missing cookie or same-site flag.\n\n[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75090385/running-playwright-with-the-local-firefox?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Running playwright with the local firefox - Stack Overflow\"\n[2]: https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Browsers - Playwright\"\n",

          "display": "Two separate problems are colliding here:\n\n---\n\n## 1 ⟂ Why the session freezes the moment MCP tries to **navigate**\n\n*Playwright can only talk to a Firefox binary that has a few project-specific patches.*\nWhen you pass `--executable-path \"/Applications/Firefox.app/…\"` it starts a vanilla Firefox that does **not** understand the extra `-juggler-pipe` flag Playwright always injects, so the browser quits at once and the protocol handshake never finishes. The MCP process keeps waiting, therefore every `navigate` (or any other) command hangs until it times out. The behaviour is documented—and has been complained about—in the Playwright issue tracker and on Stack Overflow: Playwright “doesn’t work with the branded version of Firefox since it relies on patches” and you must use the bundled build instead ([stackoverflow.com][1]). The docs also warn that `executablePath` is “use at your own risk” because the engines are patched ([playwright.dev][2]).\n\n**Bottom line:** driving the *real* Firefox with Playwright (and thus MCP) is not supported; the silent exit you’re seeing is expected.\n\n---\n\n## 2 ⟂ Why Google still says “This browser or app may not be secure” when you let MCP use the **patched** Firefox/WebKit builds\n\nGoogle’s login service fingerprints those patched test builds (and Playwright/Chromium’s automation bits) as non-production browsers. The UA strings look like *Firefox/128.0a1 Playwright* or *MiniBrowser/17.4*, navigator.webdriver is true, and a handful of Google-specific checks fail, so you always get the interstitial—even if you spoof the UA header.\n\nThere is currently **no reliable flag you can pass via MCP to make Google treat the patched Firefox or WebKit as “secure.”**\n\n---\n\n## Practical paths forward\n\n1. **Keep using Playwright’s patched Firefox but skip the login screen altogether.**\n   Do a single *manual* sign-in in a throw-away headed run, save the storage state, and feed that JSON to MCP on every run:\n\n   ```bash\n   # one-time\n   npx playwright open --browser=firefox \\\n     https://accounts.google.com \\\n     --save-storage ~/google.json\n   ```\n\n   Then\n\n   ```json5\n   \"args\": [\n     \"@playwright/mcp@latest\",\n     \"--browser\", \"firefox\",\n     \"--storage-state\", \"/Users/areeb2/google.json\"\n   ]\n   ```\n\n   When the cookies expire you just repeat the one-time step. Playwright’s own auth docs recommend exactly this pattern ([playwright.dev][3]).\n\n2. **Switch to Chromium but isolate it from your day-to-day Chrome.**\n   Launch MCP with:\n\n   ```json5\n   \"--browser\",\"chrome\",\n   \"--user-data-dir\",\"/Users/areeb2/.pwt-chrome\"\n   ```\n\n   You won’t touch your personal profile. If Google still flashes the warning, add a config file that injects the usual stealth arg `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled` (Chromium accepts it; Firefox/WebKit don’t) ­— many people report that single flag is enough to clear the interstitial ([stackoverflow.com][4]).\n\n3. **Use a different automation stack for “real” Firefox or Safari.**\n   Selenium + geckodriver or Puppeteer Classic can attach to an unpat[Pasted text #1 +22 lines]\\\n\\\nlet's do 1",

That lets you reuse your everyday profile, but at the cost of losing Playwright’s conveniences (and MCP integration).\n\n4. **Abandon UI automation for the Google step and pull OAuth tokens instead.**\n   If you only need programmatic access (Gmail API, Calendar API, etc.), the OAuth 2 Device Flow or a Service Account cuts the login UI out completely and is immune to Google’s bot-detection heuristics.\n\n---\n\n### What *won’t* work\n\n* Pointing MCP at `/Applications/Firefox.app/…` (freezes)\n* Deleting `parent.lock` and hoping Playwright will attach (it’s the wrong binary, not a lock issue)\n* Extra UA strings or `--no-sandbox` alone (Google still sees the patched build)\n* WebKit on macOS (same “MiniBrowser” fingerprint Google blocks)\n\n---\n\n**Quickest unblock right now:** run MCP with the bundled Firefox *and* `--storage-state` that contains your already-signed-in cookies. It lets you stay in a Firefox engine, avoids touching your regular Chrome install, and gets past the “secure browser” gate in one shot. If you hit any edge-case (cookies expire, 2-factor, etc.) just regenerate the JSON and keep rolling.\n\n[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75090385/running-playwright-with-the-local-firefox \"Running playwright with the local firefox - Stack Overflow\"\n[2]: https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"BrowserType - Playwright\"\n[3]: https://playwright.dev/docs/auth?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Authentication - Playwright\"\n[4]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75936459/this-browser-may-not-be-secure-error-when-trying-to-log-into-a-gmail-account-u \"selenium webdriver - \\\"This browser may not be secure\\\" error when trying to log into a Gmail account using Playwright Chromium via Playwright and Python - Stack Overflow\"\n"
