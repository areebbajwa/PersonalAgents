          "display": "My current workflow is this. I start a new terminal session which automatically starts the screen. Then I type the alias YOLO to get into claude code. Then I'll start a workflow using the workflow CLI with dev mode or task mode. That normally starts an AI monitor, but I have temporarily disabled that to auto start. The whole idea behind this is that as claude code runs, the AI monitor script is essentially checking whether it is on the right track and following the steps outlined in the dev mode or task mode workflow, as well as the to-do list that it's currently working on. It seems like the automatic logging of terminal output that is supposed to happen is not working properly. I'm not sure if it's because the screen is not logging properly or the terminal is not logging properly or both. But it seems like whatever is being sent to Gemini to figure out whether the AI is still on track using the AI monitor is not recording terminal sessions properly. you can look at some of the Gemini logs and see how it seems to be simply recording the UI of claude code instead of the actual terminal output. I did some research online. It says to use TMUX instead of screen, and the logging for that seems to be better. Another problem with screen was that you'd have to enter copy mode to be able to scroll up. But that's a lot of key combinations. And when remotely SSH-ing into the terminal session from my iphone, pressing all those key combinations to just scroll up and down is quite cumbersome. So, apparently TMUX makes scrolling easier. Also, some suggestions were to use claude Code's own internal logging because that's cleaner and doesn't include terminal control characters etc. Although that seems to happen on a per project basis. So, if you can't customize exactly when to start and stop logging for claude Code, it simply logs it for that project in that file. So, if we wanted to do a log for each workflow separately, we would need create a work tree first, which currently gets created in step 2 of the Dev Mode and Task Mode workflow. I guess we can change the YOLO alias to create the work tree first so that the log file from claude Code is in the place we want it to be and doesn't get overwritten by other projects. Because I'll be running lots of workflows starting from the same directory, I'm expecting these workflows to run in their own work tree to avoid conflicts with everything else. Can you research all this and tell me what the best solution is? ",
