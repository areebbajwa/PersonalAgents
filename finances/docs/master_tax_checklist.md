# MASTER TAX CHECKLIST

✅ **Verify GST/HST status for each BN**
   * Mpyre's RT account is clear and shows "Outstanding returns: No" and "Amount owing: $0.00"
   * Mpyre has a current credit balance of $40,548.02 CR
   * AutoOptimize has no RT account. Nothing further needed unless you create a new RT for AutoOptimize later.

⬜ **Finish the 2023 personal (T1) return**
   * What's still missing:
     * Exact dollar total of every cash draw you took from the corporate margin account in 2023
     * How you want to label those draws (loan you'll repay, salary, dividend, or mix)
     * Any personal interest income, capital gains, or deductible carrying-charges that don't appear on Auto-Fill
   * How to fetch it:
     1. Open your broker portal that holds the Tesla margin account.
        * Look for *History / Activity / CSV Export*.
        * Filter 2023 for transactions described as **"Withdraw"**, **"Cash Transfer Out"** or similar.
        * Export to CSV, copy the "Date" and "Amount" columns, paste here (you can round to the nearest dollar).
     2. Open your personal bank's online banking.
        * Find 2023 **Tax documents** or **Interest summary.**
        * If no T5 is available, pull December 2023 statement and read the year-to-date interest number.
     3. If you have any other non-registered brokerage:
        * Download 2023 **Gain/Loss** or T5008/T3/T5 PDF.
     4. Tell me: can you repay the shareholder-loan balance to the corp before its fiscal year-end + 1 year?
        * "Yes, I can" → we stick with \$0 personal income.
        * "No" or "not sure" → decide salary vs dividend (I'll explain cash-flow impact once you send the totals).
   * CRA data as of May 7, 2025:
     * Status: Not received
     * Balance: $0.00 (all 2023 balances paid as of March 20, 2025)

⬜ **File the 2024 personal (T1) return**
   * Deadline: June 15, 2025 (if self-employed); balance was due April 30

     2. Use the built-in **Auto-fill my return** (AFR) to pull all slips directly from CRA
     3. Enter any self-employment or side-gig numbers manually
     4. Netfile 2024 after filing 2023 first
   * CRA data as of May 7, 2025:

⬜ **Check the TFSA over-contribution notice**
   * What's still missing:
     * The actual excess dollar amount and the months it was assessed
   * How to fetch it:
     * The TFSA module was offline when you tried. Two work-arounds:
       1. **(Attempted May 7, 2025 - still unavailable):** Log in again outside 6 a.m.–6 p.m. Eastern; the module often re-opens after maintenance.
       2. Phone CRA's TFSA enquiries line – 1-800-267-6999 – have your SIN and PR code ready; ask for your **latest excess TFSA amount** and the **begin date**.
     * Post the excess dollar figure and the start month here; I'll tell you the exact withdrawal amount to clear it and estimate final penalties.
   * Action required:
     * Once amount is confirmed, withdraw that exact excess from your TFSA at your broker/bank the same day

⬜ **Issue Mom's 2024 T4 slip**
   * Progress so far:
     * Gross pay for 2024: $2,250.00 for 2024 based on payments from Oct-Dec 2024.

     * Pay by online banking
     * Call for a payment arrangement: 1-888-863-8657

   * How to set up direct deposit:
     * My Account → **Direct deposit** → *Add account*
   * Automated reminders options:
     * Google Calendar: Create recurring events for each filing deadline
     * API connection: Connect CRA Represent-a-Client API → Slack/Email

## NEXT STEPS

1. Export and paste the 2023 **cash-draw list** from the corporate margin account.
2. Confirm whether you can repay the shareholder loan in time.
3. Confirm the **RP0001** number for Mom's T4.
4. Retry or phone CRA for the TFSA excess figure and post it here.
5. Check incorporation documents for AutoOptimize's first fiscal year-end.

Once I have these pieces, we'll lock your 2023 return, file Mom's T4, and draft a plan for the outstanding T2s.
