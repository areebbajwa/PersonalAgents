Statements: This statement covers the statement period shown on this statement. Please review this statement carefully and advise
us of any errors within 30 days after the Statement Date. If you do not, we will consider this statement final (except for improper
credits).
Payment Due Date: The Payment Due Date is shown on your statement. It is always at least 21 days from your Statement Date.
This time period may extend depending on your payment activity. For example, if we do not receive payment of the Balance on your
statement on or before the Payment Due Date, the Payment Due Date on your next statement will be 25 days after your Statement
Date. Any interest still applies during this period. When we receive payment of the Balance on or before the Payment Due Date,
the Grace Period on your next statement will revert back to the standard 21-day Grace Period. If the Payment Due Date falls on a
Saturday, Sunday or holiday in Canada, we will extend the Payment Due Date to the following business day. Any interest still
applies during this period.
Grace Period and Interest
All Cards (except TD Venture Line of Credit Visa Cards): Interest is calculated at the applicable annual interest rate(s) as shown
on this statement. We do not charge interest on new Purchases and fees that appear for the first time on your statement ("New
Purchases") as long as we receive payment of the Balance shown on your statement on or before your Payment Due Date. If you
pay an amount that is less than your Balance shown on your statement, then we will charge interest on a New Purchase from the
transaction date until the amount of the New Purchase is paid in full. This interest-free Grace Period does not apply to Cash
Advances. We always charge interest on Cash Advances (including Balance Transfers, Cash-Like Transactions and TD Visa
Cheques) from the transaction date of the Cash Advance until the amount of the Cash Advance is paid in full. We do not charge
interest on interest.
For TD Venture Line of Credit Cards Only: We charge interest on the amount of all Transactions including Purchases, Cash
Advances (including Balance Transfers, Cash-Like Transactions, and TD Visa Cheques) and all fees or other amounts charged to
the Account from the transaction date until that amount has been paid in full. There is no interest-free Grace Period.
All Cards: For more detailed information on how and when interest is charged, see the “Grace Period and Interest” section in your
Cardholder Agreement.
Making Payments: You must pay at least the Minimum Payment shown on your statement on or before each Payment Due Date.
Payments made by mail or at the branch, ATM or online banking service of another financial institution may take several days to
reach us. You are responsible to make sure your payment is received by us on or before the Payment Due Date. If a payment is
made during our normal business hours we treat it as made on the same day, otherwise we will treat the payment as received by
us on the next business day. If paying by cheque, money order or draft, include your Account number on it and enclose with payment
remittance form (bottom portion) of your statement. For TD U.S. Dollar Visa Cards Only: All payments must be made in U.S.
dollars.
How We Apply Payments: See your Cardholder Agreement for details on how we apply payments to your Account.
Foreign Currency Conversion: Foreign currency will be converted by applying a rate established by VISA plus 2.5% as described
in more detail in the "Foreign Currency Conversion" section in your Cardholder Agreement.

Estimated Time to Pay: If we have provided you with an estimate of the length of time it will take you to pay the Balance, in full, on
this statement, if you only pay the Minimum Payment, the estimate is based on the following assumptions:(i) that we receive the
Minimum Payment shown on this statement, and the Minimum Payment on all subsequent statements, on the Payment Due Date
on those statements (not prior to that date); (ii) that each month, we receive no more than the Minimum Payment; and (iii) a 360day year. Our estimate is based on the current interest rates that apply to your Balance as of Statement Date (including any
promotional rates for any promotional period and the rate that will apply after that promotional period has expired).This estimate will
change each month if any of the assumptions in (i) and (ii) are not met, the Balance that appears on your statement changes or if
the rates that apply to your Account change. Our estimate does not include any Transactions that have not yet posted to your
Account and that are not included in the Balance that appears on this statement.
