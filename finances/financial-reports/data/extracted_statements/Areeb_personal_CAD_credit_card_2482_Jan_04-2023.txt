                             What is the minimum payment and the Payment Due Date? Your minimum payment and the Payment Due Date is set out on the front of the statement under
                             the heading "Payment Information". It is also found on the payment slip. The Primary Cardholder must pay at least the minimum payment amount by the Payment
                             Due Date shown on this statement. You must make payments in the currency of the Account. If you make a payment to the Account in a foreign currency, we may
                             reject this payment or convert your payment to the currency of the Account. To learn more about how we will convert a payment that is not made in the currency
                             of the Account, see your Cardholder Agreement. For customers with an active TD Payment Plan, you must pay your Required Payment (which is your
                             Minimum Payment less any Monthly Plan Payment Amounts due by the Minimum Payment Due Date).
                             How do you make a payment? See the front of the statement or your Cardholder Agreement to learn how you can make a payment. The Primary Cardholder
                             must select a payment method that makes sure we receive the payment so that we can post it to the Account on or before the Payment Due Date. We must
                             receive your payment so that we can post it to the Account on or before each Payment Due Date shown on the Account statement.
                             How do we apply your payment? See your Cardholder Agreement (and TD Payment Plan Amending Agreement if you have any Payment Plans) to learn

                             how we apply payments to the Account.
                             What happens if the Payment Due Date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday? If the Payment Due Date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a public
                             holiday recognized by us, we will extend the Payment Due Date to the following business day. However, any applicable interest will still apply to an outstanding
TDSTM21000_1759486_002 0070480




                             Balance during this period.
                             What is the amount that must be paid to get the benefit of a Grace Period? You have a minimum 21-day interest-free Grace Period for new Purchases and
                             fees (other than Cash Advance fees or Balance Transfer fees) that appear for the first time on the Account statement ("New Purchases"). This means that if you
                             pay the outstanding New Balance shown on the Account's statement in full on or before the Payment Due Date shown on such Account statement, you will not be
                             charged interest on New Purchases. The Grace Period does not apply to:
                                  • Purchases and fees that appear on previous Account statements,
                                  • Cash Advances (including Balance Transfers, TD Visa Cheques and Cash-Like Transactions), Cash Advance fees, Balance Transfer fees and TD Visa
                                       Cheque fees.
                             For Payment Plans Only: If you have Payment Plan(s), you will receive an interest-free Grace Period on New Purchases (excluding New Purchases that you
                             have put into a Payment Plan) if you pay the "Grace Period Payment Amount" on or before the Payment Due Date. If you have any active Payment Plans, your
                             "Grace Period Payment Amount" will be calculated as follows:
                                  • New Balance on your monthly statement, minus your Total Payment Plans balance that is shown on your monthly statement, plus your Total Monthly
                                       Payment Plan Amount(s) that are due on your monthly statement.
                             However, if you move a purchase that has already appeared on your monthly statement into a TD Payment Plan prior to the Payment Due Date of that monthly
                             statement, the Grace Period Payment Amount will be:
                                  1. If you do not have an active Payment Plan on your current monthly statement: The New Balance shown on that monthly statement minus the
                                      purchase amount(s) converted into a Payment Plan; or
                                  2. If you have active Payment Plan(s) on your current monthly statement: The Grace Period Payment Amount will be the Grace Period Payment
                                      Amount figure that is already shown on your monthly statement minus the new purchase amounts(s) moved into a Payment Plan. For greater certainty,
                                      after you convert the new purchase into a new TD Payment Plan, the amount of the new TD Payment Plan will not be included in the TD Payment Plans
                                      balance that is used to calculate the Grace Period Payment Amount that is due by the Payment Due Date of that monthly statement.
                             For TD Venture Line of Credit Only: We charge interest on the amount of all Transactions including Purchases, Cash Advances (including Balance Transfers,
                             Cash-Like Transactions, and TD Visa Cheques) and all fees or other amounts charged to the Account from the transaction date until that amount is paid in full.
                             There is no interest-free Grace Period.
                             How do we calculate and charge interest? If interest applies, you can find the total interest charged, and the associated interest rates, on the front of your
                             monthly statement. To learn more about how we calculate your interest, see your Disclosure Statement and Cardholder Agreement.
                             What is your estimated time to pay? Paying more than the minimum payment will decrease the amount of interest you pay and reduce the time it takes to repay
                             your Balance. If you have a Balance, we provide you an estimate of the length of time it will take you to pay the Balance in full as of the statement date. You can
                             find this on the front of the statement. If you only pay the minimum payment, the estimate is based on the following assumptions: (i) that we receive the minimum
                             payment on this statement, and the minimum payment on all subsequent statements, on the Payment Due Date on those statements (not prior to that date);
                             (ii) that each month, we receive on more than the minimum payment; and (iii) a 360-day year. Our estimate is based on the current interest rates that apply to your
                             Balance as a statement date (including any promotional rates for any promotional period and the rate that will apply after that promotional period has expired).
                             This estimate will change each month if any other assumptions in (i) and (ii) are not met, the Balance that appears on your statement changes or if the rates that
                             apply to your Account changes. Our estimate does not include any Transactions that have not yet posted to your Account and that are not included in the Balance
                             that appears on this statement.


                             What are your rights and obligations regarding any billing error found on this statement? This statement describes each Transaction and discloses each
                             amount credited or charged, including interest, and the dates when those amounts were posted to the Account. You must review the Account statements and
                             contact us about any errors within 30 days from the statement date so that we can immediately investigate them. If you do not contact us about errors within
                             30 days from the statement date, then:
                                  • We will consider all Transactions and payments to be correctly posted to the Account and our Records to be correct (except for any amount that we
                                       credited to the Account in error); and
                                  • You may not make a claim against us at a later date in respect of any items or amounts posted to the Account.
                             If you have a dispute with a merchant relating to a Transaction posted to the Account that appears on this statement, you must first attempt to settle the problem
                             directly with the merchant. To learn how to manage a dispute with a merchant, see your Cardholder Agreement or visit www.td.com.
