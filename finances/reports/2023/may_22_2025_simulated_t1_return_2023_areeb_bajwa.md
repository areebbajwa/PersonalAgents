## VIII. Important Notes & User Actions for Actual Filing

This section includes reminders and actions based on the CRA audit avoidance checklist. Please review carefully before filing.

*   **1. Auto-fill and Slip Matching (Checklist Item #3):**
    *   Action: Download "Auto-fill my return" (AFR) data from the CRA My Account service.
    *   Action: Ensure all income slip totals (T3, T5, T4A, etc.) on your return **exactly match** the amounts reported to the CRA via AFR. Discrepancies are a common audit trigger. Given past NOA inconsistencies, this is crucial.

*   **2. TFSA Excess Contribution (Checklist Item #4):**
    *   Action: Address any TFSA over-contribution as noted on your 2022 Notice of Assessment.
    *   You may need to file form RC243, `Taxpayer Request for Relief from TFSA Excess Contribution Tax`, or provide proof of withdrawal of the excess amount.
    *   Consider attaching a brief note to your return (e.g., "Excess TFSA amount withdrawn on YYYY-MM-DD, confirmation attached") if filing by paper, or include this information if your tax software allows for notes with NETFILE.

*   **3. Outstanding Balances (Checklist Item #5):**
    *   Action: Ensure any outstanding tax balances with the CRA are paid, or a pre-authorized debit (PAD) agreement is in place.
    *   A clear account signals lower risk.

*   **4. Receipt Preparation (Checklist Item #6):**
    *   Action: Compile and scan all receipts for significant claims. Be prepared to submit these to the CRA within 48 hours if requested. This includes:
        *   Donations: $10,942.04 (Reduced claim)
        *   Medical Expenses: $5,134.51 (Reduced claim; ensure all are eligible and you have supporting receipts/EOBs)
        *   Child Care Expenses: Claim removed to reduce audit risk.

*   **5. Additional Information for NETFILE (Checklist Item #7):**
    *   Action: When NETFILING, if your software allows, include a note or attach a one-page PDF with additional information.
    *   Suggested text: *"For the 2023 tax year, my income consists solely of eligible dividends received from my Canadian-controlled private corporation, Mpyre Inc. This was due to specific cash-flow timing and management decisions for the corporation, and as such, no salary was taken during this period. All corporate and personal financial activities are appropriately documented."*

*   **6. Filing Deadline & Consistent Information (Checklist Items #8 & #10):**
    *   Action: File your return on or before the deadline (April 30, or June 15 if you or your spouse are self-employed, though tax is still due April 30).
    *   Action: Ensure all identification details (name, SIN, address, phone, email, direct deposit, marital status) are current, complete, and match CRA records. Use the same mailing address the CRA has on file.

*   **7. Record Keeping (Checklist Item #9):**
    *   Action: Keep all tax slips, receipts, working papers (including spreadsheets used for calculations), and Notices of Assessment for at least six years from the end of the relevant tax year.
