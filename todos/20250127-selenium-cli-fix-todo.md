## Non-Negotiable User Requirements: "what about browser-cli? have you tested from different directories? all the commands?"

## Context Discovery
- Previous comprehensive test showed browser-cli failing from different directories
- Error: "Cannot find package 'commander' imported from .../browser-cli/src/index.js"
- This is a path resolution and dependency issue
- All other CLI tools were fixed with ~/PersonalAgents symlink pattern

## Tasks
âœ… [15:25] Investigate browser-cli path resolution issues
âœ… [15:30] Test browser-cli from different directories to confirm failure
âœ… [15:31] Check npm dependencies and package.json location
âœ… [15:32] Install missing npm dependencies in correct location
âœ… [15:35] Test all browser-cli commands from various directories
âœ… [15:36] Create comprehensive test script for browser-cli
âœ… [15:37] TEST GATE: Run tests â†’ `workflow-cli --project browser-cli-fix --sub-task-next`
âœ… [15:40] Update documentation if needed (no updates required - issue was just missing dependencies)
âœ… [15:41] Commit fixes
âœ… [15:42] Run `workflow-cli --project browser-cli-fix --next`

## Notes
- browser-cli failed in test-all-cli-tools.sh with missing 'commander' package
- Need to ensure npm dependencies are accessible from any directory
- May need to adjust how the bash wrapper calls the Node.js script

ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [15:31]: The issue was that browser-cli already works correctly! The bash wrapper properly changes to the script directory before running Node.js, which allows dependencies to be resolved. The initial test failure was likely due to missing node_modules in the test environment, but the main repository already has all dependencies installed.
