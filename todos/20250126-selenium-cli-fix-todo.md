## Non-Negotiable User Requirements: "selenium cli has confusing help and some of the commands don't seem to work properly. test and make sure it passes for non-headless firefox with default profile. help should only mention the commands that actually exist and work. these commands seem to run in foreground and make everything freeze! all commands should return right away after doing what they're supposed to. it should keep the process alive but exit right away. future commands should send to the same process. shouldn't have to launch. navigate should launch if browser hasn't launched yet"

## Context Discovery
- Main selenium-cli implementation: cli_tools/selenium-cli/index.js
- Multiple test files exist in cli_tools/selenium-cli/: test.js, test-e2e.js, test-session.js, etc.
- Key issue: Commands hang/block instead of returning immediately
- Help text contains outdated MCP-style commands that don't exist

## Tasks
âœ… [00:15] Analyze why commands are blocking/hanging
âœ… [00:25] Fix command blocking issue - all commands should return immediately
âœ… [00:30] Update help text to remove non-existent MCP-style commands
âœ… [00:30] Ensure help only shows commands that actually work
âœ… [00:40] Write/update E2E test for non-headless Firefox with default profile
âœ… [00:45] TEST GATE: Run all tests â†’ `workflow-cli --project selenium-cli-fix --sub-task-next`
âœ… [00:50] Test each command manually to ensure they work and return immediately
âœ… [00:50] Fix any commands that don't work properly
âœ… [00:55] Write comprehensive test for all commands
âœ… [00:55] TEST GATE: Final test run â†’ `workflow-cli --project selenium-cli-fix --sub-task-next`
ðŸ•’ Commit fixes with test status
ðŸ•’ Run `workflow-cli --project selenium-cli-fix --next`

## Notes
- Commands currently timeout/hang when executed
- Help text shows examples for commands like "start_browser", "click_element" which don't match actual command names
- Need to ensure all commands work with non-headless Firefox using default profile
