## Notes
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [18:13]: Found existing ai_cache_utils.js for Gemini integration - can reuse instead of building from scratch
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [18:15]: --remind-rules command works perfectly as alias for --sub-task-next
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [18:16]: Screen monitor script handles terminal escape sequences and file rotation
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [18:22]: Gemini 2.5 Pro API integration works with real violation detection
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [18:29]: Complete notification and keypress guidance system implemented
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [18:38]: Production verification confirms all systems operational
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [18:42]: Converted to proper CLI tool following PersonalAgents design standards
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [18:50]: Implemented YAML format for clean Gemini responses
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [18:52]: Added smart state detection to avoid interrupting user input

## Production Verification Results
âœ… --remind-rules command works in production
âœ… Screen monitor detects real violations with Gemini API
âœ… Notification system captures and logs violations
âœ… Keypress guidance extraction and screen command generation working
âœ… Complete end-to-end workflow operational

## Final Project Structure
- `cli_tools/ai-manager-cli/` - Complete CLI tool with monitor, notifications, status commands
- `cli_tools/ai-manager-cli/src/screen-monitor.js` - Core monitoring with Gemini integration
- `cli_tools/ai-manager-cli/src/notification-manager.js` - Notification and logging system
- `cli_tools/ai-manager-cli/src/index.js` - CLI interface using commander.js
- Modified `cli_tools/workflow-cli/workflow-cli.py` - Added AI Manager integration and --remind-rules

## AI Manager System Complete ðŸŽ‰
The AI Manager system is fully operational and production-ready with:
- Real-time screen monitoring (1-minute intervals)
- Gemini 2.5 Pro workflow compliance analysis with full YAML rules
- Automatic violation detection and text-based guidance
- Smart state detection (WAITING_FOR_USER, WORKFLOW_COMPLETE)
- Auto-start on workflow step 1, auto-stop on cleanup
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring dashboard
- YAML response format for clean parsing
- 5-minute remind-rules command scheduling
