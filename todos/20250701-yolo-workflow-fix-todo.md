# 20250701-yolo-workflow-fix-todo.md
Last updated: 2025-01-01 10:57

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
All requirements have been successfully implemented and tested.

## Non-Negotiable User Requirements
- When starting YOLO with a project name, starting workflow-cli later should use the same project name automatically

## Context Discovery
- YOLO creates worktrees with pattern: `worktrees/[project-name]-YYYYMMDD`
- workflow-cli requires explicit `--project` parameter currently
- No auto-detection of project from current directory exists
- AI Monitor has some auto-detection logic from state files

## Simplified Solution
- Add auto-detection to workflow-cli that extracts project name from current worktree directory
- If in `/worktrees/[project-name]-YYYYMMDD/`, extract `[project-name]-YYYYMMDD` as project
- Fall back to existing behavior if not in worktree or if `--project` is explicitly provided

## Tasks
- [10:45] ✅ Add project auto-detection logic to workflow-cli __init__ method
- [10:48] ✅ Write test to verify auto-detection works correctly
- [10:49] ✅ TEST GATE: Run test - MUST PASS
- [10:49] ✅ Mark test passed: `workflow-cli --project yolo-workflow-fix --sub-task-next`
- [10:50] ✅ Commit with test status: `git commit -m "feat: add project auto-detection - tests: 1/1 passed"`
- [10:51] ✅ Test manual workflow: yolo test-project → workflow-cli (no --project) → verify same project
- [10:54] ✅ Update CLI help text to mention auto-detection feature
- [10:55] ✅ Run workflow-cli --project yolo-workflow-fix --next

## Notes
- Simplest solution: check if cwd contains `/worktrees/` and extract directory name
- No need to modify YOLO function or create complex state management
- Backwards compatible - explicit --project still works
