# 20250105-write-to-test-file-every-5-sec-todo.md

## Non-Negotiable User Requirements: "write to test file every 5 seconds for 2 minutes"

## Context Discovery
- Task is straightforward: create a script that writes to a file at 5-second intervals
- Total runtime: 2 minutes (120 seconds)
- Number of writes: 24 writes (120/5 = 24)
- No similar tasks found in existing todos

## Tasks
✅ [00:01] Set up worktree environment
✅ [00:02] Create implementation plan
✅ [00:03] Create test file script that writes every 5 seconds
✅ [00:03] Implement 2-minute duration control
✅ [00:03] Add timestamp to each write for verification
✅ [00:04] Test script execution
✅ [00:06] Verify output file contains 24 entries
✅ [00:07] Run workflow continue write-to-test-file-every-5-sec

## Task Completed Successfully
- Created test_writer.py script
- Script successfully wrote to test_output.txt every 5 seconds
- Total runtime: 115.12 seconds (~2 minutes)
- Total writes: 24 (as expected)
- All requirements met

## Implementation Plan
- Use Python or shell script for simplicity
- Write current timestamp to file every 5 seconds
- Use a counter or timer to stop after 2 minutes
- Each write should append to the file (not overwrite)

## Notes
- Simple task requiring basic file I/O and timing control
- No external dependencies needed
