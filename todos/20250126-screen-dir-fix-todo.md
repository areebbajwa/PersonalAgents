## Tasks
âœ… [22:52] Set up project structure and git branch
âœ… [22:58] Discovered the real issue - worktree commands were removed from workflow
âœ… [22:58] Restore worktree commands to dev-mode.yaml from main branch
âœ… [23:00] Restore worktree commands to task-mode.yaml if needed - Not needed, task mode uses regular branches
âœ… [23:00] Test the restored workflows locally - Verified worktree commands are shown
âœ… [23:02] TEST GATE: Verify worktree creation and cd works properly - PASSED
âœ… [23:05] Commit with message about restoring worktree functionality
âœ… [23:10] Realized the ACTUAL issue - screen auto-start not preserving directory
âœ… [23:10] Identify why screen auto-start doesn't preserve working directory - Found: defshell -zsh starts login shell
âœ… [23:15] Fix the source order in temporary screenrc files - Added defshell zsh override
âœ… [23:18] Test the fix with new terminal sessions - Verified chdir works
âœ… [23:16] Update all screen tools to use correct source order - Updated all tools
âœ… [23:20] Commit the fix
âœ… [23:20] Final testing and cleanup
âœ… [23:20] Run `workflow-cli --project screen-dir-fix --next`

## Notes
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [22:50]: The issue is that workflow-cli shows cd commands but doesn't execute them - users need to run them manually
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [22:58]: The real issue - worktree commands were removed from the workflow in commit f477ea3!
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [23:10]: The ACTUAL issue - screen auto-start creates sessions but doesn't preserve working directory
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [23:15]: Found root cause - defshell -zsh in .screenrc starts login shell which changes to home directory
