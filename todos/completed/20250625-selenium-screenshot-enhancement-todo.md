# Selenium Screenshot Enhancement Todo

## Objective
Modify the selenium MCP server to take screenshots after each action and output the path in the response.

## Tasks

✅ Create screenshot helper function that saves to a dedicated directory
✅ Update navigate action to take screenshot after navigation  
✅ Update click_element action to take screenshot after click
✅ Update send_keys action to take screenshot after typing
✅ Update other state-changing actions (hover, drag_and_drop, etc.)
✅ Write E2E test to verify screenshots are created
✅ Run tests and ensure all pass
✅ Commit changes with test status
✅ Add cleanup mechanism to delete screenshots older than 24h

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Screenshot Helper Function
- Create dedicated screenshots directory
- Use timestamp-based filenames
- Return file path
- Handle errors gracefully

### 2. Actions to Update (state-changing only)
- navigate
- click_element
- send_keys
- hover
- drag_and_drop
- double_click
- right_click
- press_key
- upload_file

### 3. Response Format
Add `screenshot_path` field to response content for each action that takes a screenshot.

## Notes
- Following Musk's simplification: Only screenshot actions that change page state
- Skip screenshots for find_element, get_element_text (read-only actions)
- Use async screenshot capture to not block action execution

## Completion Summary
✅ All tasks completed successfully!
- Screenshot functionality added to all state-changing actions
- Automatic cleanup mechanism prevents screenshot accumulation
- Tests verify both screenshot creation and cleanup
- Changes committed with passing test status
