## Notes
- Issue: "Operation not permitted" when running sr from home directory via SSH
- Ngrok tunnel is running at 7.tcp.ngrok.io:21775
- Need to test with actual SSH connection to reproduce
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [20:40]: Can't test via SSH without key. Need to reproduce issue locally by simulating SSH environment
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [20:41]: The issue is 'mapfile' command not found - it's a bash 4+ feature not available in older bash
