## Notes
- Existing screen-tools in /Volumes/ExtremeSSD/PersonalAgents/PersonalAgents/cli_tools/screen-tools/
- Auto-start feature in .zshrc already creates session names based on directory
- Will use deflog and logfile directives in .screenrc
- Global access already configured via aliases in .zshrc
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [20:14]: deflog doesn't work with detached sessions created with -d. Need to modify screen creation scripts to enable logging explicitly
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [20:21]: Logging is working! The log captures the shell prompt but test message timing needs adjustment
