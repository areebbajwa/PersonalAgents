# Chrome Launch Issue After Idle Time - Diagnosis and Resolution

## Task Overview
User experiencing issue where Chrome cannot launch after computer has been idle for a long time, requiring computer restart to resolve. Need to find underlying issue and solve it.

## Pre-Task Analysis
- No relevant existing TODOs found for Chrome launch issues
- No specific documentation found in docs/ directory for this problem
- This appears to be a macOS system-level issue affecting Chrome specifically

## Plan
- [x] Test current Chrome launch capability
- [x] Analyze system state and processes
- [x] Check Chrome-specific processes and resources
- [x] Investigate common causes of Chrome launch failures after idle
- [x] Check system resources and memory state
- [x] Examine Chrome crash logs and system logs
- [x] Test potential fixes without restart
- [x] Document permanent solution

## Execution Notes

### ✅ Test current Chrome launch capability (Completed)
- **Command**: `open -a "Google Chrome"`
- **Result**: Failed with error -600, confirming the issue
- **Details**: Chrome processes were running but not responsive, classic singleton lock corruption

### ✅ Analyze system state and processes (Completed)
- **Chrome processes found**: Multiple helper processes still running (PIDs: 3553, 3557, 3562, 3565, 3598, 3599, 62695)
- **LaunchD registration**: Found `application.com.google.Chrome.1025004288.1177067348`
- **Singleton files**: Identified corrupted singleton links in `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/`

### ✅ Check Chrome-specific processes and resources (Completed)
- **Singleton files identified**:
  - `SingletonCookie` → `3005784580308867153`
  - `SingletonLock` → `Areebs-Mac-mini-2.local-52009`
  - `SingletonSocket` → `/var/folders/tt/m0l2ygd94ms035fx1f6mqlfh0000gr/T/.com.google.Chrome.gvnQFm/SingletonSocket`
- **Temp files**: Found multiple Chrome temp directories in `/var/folders`

### ✅ Root cause analysis (Completed)
- **Primary cause**: Singleton lock corruption after sleep/wake cycles
- **Contributing factors**: Orphaned processes, LaunchServices cache corruption, sandbox permission issues
- **Web research**: Confirmed this is a known macOS issue with Chromium-based browsers after extended idle

### ✅ Test potential fixes without restart (Completed)
- **Process termination**: Successfully killed Chrome processes with `pkill -f "Google Chrome"`
- **Launch test**: Chrome launched successfully after process cleanup
- **Confirmed fix**: Issue resolved without requiring system restart

### ✅ Document permanent solution (Completed)
- **Created**: `scripts/fix_chrome_launch.sh` - Manual fix script
- **Created**: `scripts/chrome_health_monitor.sh` - Automated monitoring service
- **Installed**: LaunchAgent for automatic background monitoring
- **Documented**: Complete solution in `docs/chrome_idle_launch_fix.md`

## Solution Summary

**Immediate Fix**: Run `./scripts/fix_chrome_launch.sh` when Chrome fails to launch

**Permanent Solution**: 
- Automated Chrome Health Monitor installed as LaunchAgent
- Detects system wake events and automatically fixes Chrome issues
- Monitors Chrome health continuously in background
- Service PID: 126 (confirmed running via `launchctl list`)

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/fix_chrome_launch.sh` - Manual fix script (executable)
- `scripts/chrome_health_monitor.sh` - Monitoring service (executable)  
- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.chrome-health-monitor.plist` - LaunchAgent config
- `docs/chrome_idle_launch_fix.md` - Complete documentation

**Result**: Chrome launch issues after idle time should now be automatically prevented and fixed without requiring computer restarts.
