## Final Status
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Successfully upgraded record-cli to use Gemini 2.5 Pro!
- Resolved 500 errors with Gemini 2.5 models for video analysis
- Discovered File Upload API is required for Gemini 2.5 video processing
- Upgraded from gemini-1.5-flash to gemini-2.5-pro with enhanced analysis quality
- Maintained all existing functionality while improving AI capabilities
- Committed and pushed changes to main branch

## Tasks Completed
‚úÖ [17:45] Research Gemini 2.5 video analysis API requirements and limitations
- Discovered File Upload API is preferred for video analysis
- Found that 2.5 models have 500 errors with inline base64 data
- Learned about processing states and file URI workflow

‚úÖ [17:55] Test different request formats for gemini-2.5-pro video analysis
- Confirmed 500 errors with inline base64 approach
- Created test scripts to validate different API approaches
- Tested multiple models: 2.5-pro, 2.5-flash, 1.5-pro, 1.5-flash

‚úÖ [18:05] Try different API endpoints and parameters for Gemini 2.5
- Tested streamGenerateContent vs generateContent endpoints
- Experimented with different generationConfig parameters
- Confirmed both 2.5-pro and 2.5-flash work with File Upload API

‚úÖ [18:10] Test file upload API vs inline data for large videos
- Successfully implemented File Upload API workflow
- Verified 3-step process: upload ‚Üí wait for processing ‚Üí analyze
- Both gemini-2.5-pro and gemini-2.5-flash work perfectly with File API

‚úÖ [18:15] Update record-cli to use working Gemini 2.5 configuration
- Replaced entire upload_to_gemini method with File Upload API approach
- Added proper file processing state monitoring
- Implemented robust error handling for upload and processing failures

‚úÖ [18:20] Final testing and validation with gemini-2.5-pro
- Successfully recorded and analyzed video with detailed timestamps
- Confirmed enhanced analysis quality compared to 1.5 models
- Verified all existing CLI features work with new implementation

## Technical Breakthrough
üî• **KEY DISCOVERY**: Gemini 2.5 models require File Upload API for video analysis
- ‚ùå Inline base64 data ‚Üí 500 Internal Server Error
- ‚úÖ File Upload API ‚Üí Perfect functionality
- Process: Upload file ‚Üí Wait for ACTIVE state ‚Üí Send analysis request with fileUri

## API Workflow Implemented
```
1. Upload video to: https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/upload/v1beta/files
2. Monitor processing: GET /v1beta/{file_name} until state = 'ACTIVE'  
3. Analyze video: POST /v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent with fileData.fileUri
```

## Quality Improvements
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Gemini 2.5 Pro provides more detailed and accurate video descriptions
- **Better Timestamps**: More precise event detection and timing
- **UI Element Recognition**: Improved detection of specific interface elements
- **User Action Tracking**: Better identification of user interactions and typing

## Files Modified
- `cli_tools/record-cli/record-cli` - Complete rewrite of upload_to_gemini method
- Added File Upload API workflow with proper error handling
- Upgraded from gemini-1.5-flash to gemini-2.5-pro

## Commit Details
- **Commit**: `3d9eba7` - "feat: upgrade record-cli to use Gemini 2.5 Pro with File Upload API"
- **Branch**: main
- **Status**: Committed and pushed successfully

## Research Sources
- Gemini Developer API documentation on file handling
- Google AI Developers Forum discussions on 2.5 model limitations
- Video understanding capabilities documentation
- File Upload API specifications and examples

## Notes
- File Upload API is the future-proof approach for Gemini video analysis
- Files are automatically deleted after 48 hours by Google
- Method works for videos up to 2GB in size
- Processing time is typically under 10 seconds for small videos
- Enhanced context window (1M+ tokens) enables better video understanding
