The main issue was user education - users need to know about copy mode (Ctrl-a [) to scroll in screen.

## Notes
- Issue: User can't scroll up when in screen
- Root cause: Need to use copy mode (Ctrl-a then [ or ESC)
- Solution: Better config + documentation
- Consider iOS compatibility (altscreen setting)

ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [18:18]: The scrolling issue is simply user education - screen requires copy mode for scrolling, which many users don't know about. Added clear documentation and improved .screenrc with helpful comments.
