# TODO: Create PDF AI CLI Tool

**Task Identifier**: may_27_2025_create_pdf_ai_cli_tool

## Overview
Create a simple CLI tool that converts PDF files to text using AI. The tool's sole job is to process a PDF and output the extracted text to a text file.

## Pre-Task Contextual Analysis Completed
- [X] **Existing PDF Processing Infrastructure Identified**
  - Found robust PDF processing script: `finances/scripts/may_26_2025_process_pdf_statements.js`
  - Uses OpenAI GPT-4o with AI caching utilities for efficient processing
  - Successfully processed 118 PDFs with text extraction capabilities
  - Includes AI caching to prevent redundant API calls

- [X] **CLI Tools Structure Analyzed**
  - Found `cli_tools/` directory with established patterns
  - Existing desktop-automation-cli provides good reference architecture
  - Clear separation between `tools/` (LangChain agents) and `cli_tools/` (standalone)

- [X] **AI Caching System Available**
  - `utils/ai_cache_utils.js` provides caching infrastructure
  - Supports OpenAI and Gemini models with content hashing
  - Prevents redundant API calls for same content

    - Help command works properly
    - Input validation working correctly
    - API key validation working correctly
  - [X] **End-to-end testing with actual PDF processing** - ✅ COMPLETED
    - ✅ Tested with valid OpenAI API key from config/.env
    - ✅ Successfully extracted 7,007 characters from example.pdf
    - ✅ Verified text output file creation and content accuracy
    - ✅ Confirmed AI caching works correctly (second run used cache)
    - ✅ Assistant creation and reuse working properly
    - ✅ Progress indicators and verbose output functioning
  - [X] Create usage examples - ✅ COMPLETED
    - Built into help command with multiple examples
    - Environment variable documentation included

    - Comprehensive help output with all options
    - Self-documenting code structure

## Implementation Details

**File Structure:**
```
cli_tools/pdf-ai-cli/
├── package.json          # Node.js project configuration
├── pdf-ai                # Shell wrapper script (executable)
└── src/
    ├── index.js          # Main CLI entry point (executable)
    ├── pdfProcessor.js   # PDF processing class with AI integration
    └── aiCache.js        # AI caching utilities (copied from finances)
```

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Simple Usage**: `./pdf-ai input.pdf output.txt`
- **AI Caching**: Prevents redundant API calls for same PDFs
- **Progress Feedback**: Clear spinner with status updates
- **Error Handling**: Validates inputs and API key availability
- **Verbose Mode**: Optional detailed output and error info
- **Self-Contained**: All dependencies managed via npm

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4o with Assistants API for reliable text extraction
- Implements content-based caching using SHA256 hashes
- Follows established CLI tools patterns from existing codebase
- ES modules with proper error handling and exit codes

## Success Criteria - ✅ ALL COMPLETED
- [X] Simple command: `pdf-ai input.pdf output.txt`
- [X] **Extracts full text content from PDF using AI** - ✅ VERIFIED
- [X] **Outputs clean text to specified file** - ✅ VERIFIED
- [X] Uses AI caching to avoid redundant processing - ✅ VERIFIED
- [X] Clear error messages and documentation

## Testing Results - ✅ SUCCESSFUL
