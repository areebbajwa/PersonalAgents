    - [x] Extract all transactions from `tagged_transactions_2023` table in `personal.db` for the calendar year 2023.
        - **Note:** Data was historically exported via SQLite query to `finances/data_exports/2023/tagged_transactions_for_analysis_2023.csv` (this CSV and its directory have since been removed). Analysis now proceeds directly from `data/personal.db` or uses other existing reports.
    - [x] Analyze extracted transactions using `ai_category`, `ai_tags`, and **`PrimaryCategory`** to identify and sum up common income types.
        - **Note:** Analysis (e.g., via `python scripts/analyze_tagged_tax_transactions.py`) was historically run on the (now removed) `finances/data_exports/2023/tagged_transactions_for_analysis_2023.csv`. Output of that historical analysis was saved to `finances/reports/tax_analysis_summary_UPDATED.txt` and `finances/reports/2023/detailed_tax_analysis_2023.json`.
