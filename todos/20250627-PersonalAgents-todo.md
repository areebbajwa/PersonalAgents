## Non-Negotiable User Requirements: "investigate and fix the issue with the monitor not recognizing and showing state for selenium-cli-fix project"

## Context Discovery
- Issue: ai-monitor-cli monitor-all command not showing active monitors
- Root cause: Typo in code looking for 'ai_manager_pid_' instead of 'ai_monitor_pid_'
- Fixed in: cli_tools/ai-monitor-cli/src/index.js:279

## Tasks
âœ… [23:18] Investigate why ai-monitor-cli monitor-all doesn't show selenium-cli-fix project
âœ… [23:19] Check ai-monitor state file locations and format
âœ… [23:20] Fix the state recognition issue (typo: ai_manager_pid_ â†’ ai_monitor_pid_)
âœ… [23:21] Test the fix with all running monitors

### Feature: Test Coverage for Monitor-All
ðŸ•’ Write test for monitor-all command
ðŸ•’ TEST GATE â†’ `--sub-task-next`
ðŸ•’ Commit: "fix: correct pid file prefix in monitor-all command"

### Final Steps
ðŸ•’ Final testing and cleanup
ðŸ•’ Run `workflow-cli --project PersonalAgents --next`

## Notes
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [23:19]: Found the issue was a simple typo in the prefix check
- Monitor processes ARE running but weren't being detected due to wrong prefix
- screen-scroll-config monitor is running but lacks PID file (started outside workflow)
