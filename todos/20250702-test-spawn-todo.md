# 20250702-test-spawn-todo.md

## Non-Negotiable User Requirements: "test task mode workflow that spawns a dev mode from inside it"

## Context Discovery
- CLI Tool Development rule in task-mode.yaml: line 257
- Example spawn command format provided in workflow

## Tasks
✅ [15:49] Create a sample task that requires a CLI tool
✅ [15:50] Build sample-data-cli tool: spawn new agent with "workflow-cli --project sample-data-cli --mode dev --step 1"
✅ [15:51] Wait for dev mode workflow to complete - FOUND: runs in same instance, blocks task mode
❌ [15:51] Test the newly created CLI tool - SKIPPED: dev mode would block task mode
✅ [15:51] Document the spawn behavior
🕒 Run workflow-cli --project test-spawn --next

## Notes
- Testing how task mode spawns dev mode workflows
- Will observe if separate process is created
🔥 BREAKTHROUGH [15:50]: Dev mode workflow starts in SAME Claude instance, not separate process
- This means task mode is blocked while dev mode runs
- To truly spawn independent workflow, would need: open new terminal → yolo sample-data-cli → run workflow-cli
