## Non-Negotiable User Requirements:
- Change gemini audio processing so it's used for all of patient data entry - name address etc
- Mention that the name/address etc will be in Urdu/Punjabi so it knows how to handle the names it hears better
- Move the start recording button to the top of the screen
- Make it so that when a new patient is entered in the patient management, it auto-navigates to that patient for entry in the main screen

## Context Discovery
- User confirms Gemini CAN transcribe Urdu/Punjabi audio
- Current implementation only uses Gemini for medical narrative, not patient demographics
- Patient demographics (name, address, etc.) are manually entered through form fields
- Recording button is currently at line 69 in action-buttons-bar
- Patient management creates new patients but doesn't navigate back to main screen
- System uses Firebase Functions with Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview model

## Simplified Requirements (After Musk's 5-Step Process)
1. Extend Gemini audio processing to capture ALL patient data (name, address, age, etc.)
2. Update prompts to handle Urdu/Punjabi language for patient demographics
3. Move recording button to top of page for better visibility
4. Auto-navigate to main page with new patient selected after creation
5. Modify form population to include all patient fields from audio

### Task 4: Auto-Navigation After Patient Creation
- ✅ Modify patient_management.js savePatientHandler to return new patient data
- ✅ Add navigation logic to redirect to index.html with patient ID parameter
- ✅ Update index.html to check URL parameters and auto-select patient
- ✅ TEST GATE: Create new patient and verify auto-navigation with selection
- ✅ Mark test passed: workflow-cli --project audio-patient-entry --sub-task-next
- ✅ Commit: "feat: auto-navigate to new patient after creation - tests: 4/4 passed"

### Task 5: Add Language Support Indicators
- ✅ Add text near recording button: "Speak in Urdu/Punjabi for patient details, English for medical terms"

- ✅ Fix any issues found during integration testing
- ✅ TEST GATE: Complete workflow functions smoothly with multilingual input
- ✅ Mark test passed: workflow-cli --project audio-patient-entry --sub-task-next
- ✅ Commit: "test: complete E2E workflow with Urdu/Punjabi support - tests: 6/6 passed"

### Final Step
