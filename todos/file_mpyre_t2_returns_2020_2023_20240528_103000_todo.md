## Notes & Knowledge:
*   Mpyre Software Inc. BN: 807356423
*   GRIP balance as of 2019: \$1,654,048.
*   T2s must be filed with Schedule 53 to update GRIP.
*   Filing order: 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023.
*   Late-filing penalties are expected.
*   No corporate tax, GST/HST, or payroll balances currently owing (as per knowledge base).
*   Large \$11,920 CR carry-back on 2014-12-31 period-end, will offset penalties.
*   No T5 penalty or gross negligence letters yet, but at risk.
*   Demand to file T2 letters have been received.
*   This task assumes that the user has access to the necessary financial records for Mpyre Software Inc. for the fiscal years 2020-2023.
*   Filing will likely need to be done via certified tax software or a tax professional, as direct CRA online filing for overdue T2s can be complex. This plan assumes the agent will guide the *preparation* and the user will handle the actual *submission* if it requires specialized software not accessible to the agent.
