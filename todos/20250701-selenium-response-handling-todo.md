## FINAL STATUS: ✅ ALL REQUIREMENTS MET

## Non-Negotiable User Requirements
- Research how browsermcp and playwright-mcp handle responses after each action so that the AI knows the new page state
- Update selenium-cli with similar ideas
- Make sure each action returns HTML diff after each action
- Want to stick with selenium not playwright
- Read the github code if needed
- Research how these tools return the new page elements back to the client so that the AI knows which element to interact with next

## Context Discovery
- Playwright MCP uses accessibility tree snapshots (structured data, not screenshots)
- Each element has a "ref" identifier for precise targeting
- Selenium-cli already has HTML diff functionality but lacks element discovery
- Current selenium-cli returns: screenshot, html file, and htmlDiff stats
- Need to add interactive element information to responses

## Simplified Approach (After 5-Step Analysis)
- Use Selenium's native findElements capability
- Return simple JSON with essential element info (tag, text, id, class, name, href)
- Include CSS selectors for each interactive element
- Keep it lightweight - no complex accessibility tree parsing

## Tasks

### 1. ✅ [08:58] Add getInteractiveElements function to browser-manager.js
- Create function to find all interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, selects, textareas)
- Return array with: tag, text, id, class, name, href, cssSelector
- Write unit test for element discovery

### 2. ✅ [09:10] Update session-server.js to include elements in responses
- Modify saveActionHtml to also get interactive elements
- Add elements array to response after navigate, click, type actions
- Ensure backwards compatibility with existing response format

### 3. ✅ [09:10] Create test page with various interactive elements
- HTML file with buttons, links, forms, dropdowns
- Use for testing element discovery functionality
- Include edge cases (hidden elements, disabled elements)

### 4. ✅ [09:13] Write E2E tests for element discovery
- Test that navigate returns correct elements
- Test that elements update after interactions
- Test performance with pages having many elements

### 5. ✅ [09:25] Update CLI output formatting
- Add option to display interactive elements in response
- Keep it readable in terminal output
- Add --show-elements flag
- Run workflow-cli --project selenium-response-handling --sub-task-next after test passes

### 6. ✅ [09:28] Test with real websites
- Test on Google search page
- Test on form-heavy sites
- Verify element selectors work correctly
- Run workflow-cli --project selenium-response-handling --sub-task-next after test passes

### 7. ✅ [09:31] Documentation update
- Update README with new element discovery feature
- Add examples of using returned elements
- Document response format changes

### 8. ✅ [09:32] Run workflow-cli --project selenium-response-handling --next

## Notes
- Keep implementation simple - Selenium native methods only
- Focus on practical element identification for AI interaction
- Performance is important - don't slow down existing operations
