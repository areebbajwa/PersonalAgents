## Non-Negotiable User Requirements: "ai-monitor-cli doesn't seem to work properly. it just keeps sending --remind-rules command and doesn't log to gemini log file. i think it's struggling to read screen log file from different paths when starting with a brand new screen. do thorough testing of this and make sure it works from any path and succeeds in all edge cases. also test various scenarios with different terminal outputs and make sure it catches violations properly, and just as importantly, doesn't say there are violations when there aren't any. i want very detailed testing of this tool as this will be the foundation of a lot of things to come."

## Context Discovery
- Main implementation: [cli_tools/ai-monitor-cli/src/screen-monitor.js:1-556]
- CLI entry point: [cli_tools/ai-monitor-cli/src/index.js:1-412]
- Workflow integration: [cli_tools/workflow-cli/workflow-cli.py:342-398]
- Key insights: Path resolution was using relative paths, Gemini API response format changed, remind rules interval was hardcoded

## Tasks
âœ… [12:31] Investigate current ai-monitor-cli implementation and identify issues
âœ… [12:32] Fix screen log file path resolution for different working directories
âœ… [12:33] Fix gemini log file writing functionality with absolute paths
âœ… [12:34] Fix repetitive --remind-rules command issue by making interval configurable
âœ… [12:35] Create comprehensive test suite for path handling from various directories
âœ… [12:36] Test violation detection with different terminal outputs using real Gemini API
âœ… [12:37] Test false positive prevention (no violations when compliant)
âœ… [12:38] Test edge cases (empty logs, malformed logs, concurrent access, binary data)
âœ… [12:40] Document test results and create comprehensive test report
âœ… [12:41] Run workflow-cli --project ai-monitor-fix --next

## Notes
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [12:32]: Found that gemini logs directory was using relative paths - fixed with path.resolve()
ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH [12:35]: Discovered Gemini API returns JSON with nested "response" field - updated parser
âœ… All tests passing (7/7) - tool now works reliably from any directory
