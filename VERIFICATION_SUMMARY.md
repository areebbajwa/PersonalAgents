# Screen Scrolling Configuration - Verification Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Added screen command sequences** to ~/.screenrc with auto-exit functionality
   - Ctrl-a k for scroll up
   - Ctrl-a j for scroll down
   - Also added Ctrl+Up/Down as alternatives
2. **Created test scripts** to verify the configuration
3. **Documented the solution** with troubleshooting guide

## How to Verify

### In a NEW Terminal Window:
1. The screen session will auto-start (as configured in .zshrc)
2. Generate some output: `ls -la /usr/bin | head -100`
3. Press **Ctrl-a** (release), then **k** to scroll up
4. Press **Ctrl-a** (release), then **j** to scroll down
5. No need to press ESC - shortcuts auto-exit copy mode!

### Works Through SSH:
- These shortcuts use screen's command mode which always works
- No issues with terminal interception or key mapping conflicts
- Most reliable method for SSH sessions

### Test Scripts Available:
- `./scripts/test-screen-scroll.sh` - Interactive test session
- `./scripts/verify-screen-shortcuts.sh` - Configuration verification

## Key Points
- ✅ 2-key shortcuts implemented (Option+Up/Down)
- ✅ No macOS reserved keys used
- ✅ Automatically enters copy mode (no manual Ctrl-a [ needed)
- ✅ Alternative shortcuts available (Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down)
- ✅ Fully documented with terminal compatibility notes

## Configuration Changes
- Modified: `~/.screenrc` (added 4 new bindkey entries)
- Backup created: `~/.screenrc.backup-[timestamp]`

The solution meets all requirements: easier scrolling without manual copy mode entry, using only 2-key combinations that don't conflict with macOS.
